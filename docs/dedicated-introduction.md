## Introduction

Are you looking for your own server with powerful configuration at a fair price? Then ZAP-Hosting is the right place for you! At ZAP-Hosting you can rent or buy your suitable dedicated server and get hardware for a maximum performance experience! 

Unlike a virtual server (vRootserver), you will have your own physical hardware with a dedicated server. This means that when you rent/buy a Dedicated Server, the full power of all components is available only to you and your applications. Virtual servers, on the other hand, run on a host system whose resources are shared with other virtual servers.



## Order

The ordering process is very simple. Select your desired configuration for your [Dedicated Server](https://zap-hosting.com/en/dedicated-server-hosting/). The setup time of the dedicated server depends on the availability. You can check this by having a look at the status symbol next to the flag for each configuration. The status **Green** means that the configuration is available and will be ready within a few minutes. If the status **Orange** is displayed for the configuration, the configuration is not immediately available and has to be assembled. The time for the setup is approximately 5 business days (monday-friday).



## Configurations

For our Dedicated Servers we offer numerous configuration variants, which means that you should be able to find the right system for every use case. Our configurations are generally made up of the following possible options:

| Hardware components | Available options                                            |
