## Introduction
Minecraft offers the option to add your own server icon, which is displayed in multiplayer in front of the server, provided the server has been saved.

## Add the icon

To add the icon, FTP rights and the icon itself are required.

>Important: The icon must be 64x64 pixels in size and bear the name server-icon.png. 

First, a connection is established via FTP to the game server, how exactly that works can be seen here: https://docs.zap-hosting.com/docs/en/gameserver-ftpaccess/

As soon as the connection is established, you can see the server data such as:

The icon must now be uploaded to the main directory, it must not be uploaded to any subdirectory:

Once this has been done, the server must now be started / restarted using the control buttons in the web interface at the top right of the respective server:

## Checking the icon 

If the name and size have now been matched, it is displayed in multiplayer in front of the server:

The icon can also be exchanged or deleted at any time in this way.
