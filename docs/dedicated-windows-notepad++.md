- **Editor Settings**: Adjust font type and size, tab width, line numbering, auto-indentation, or whether spaces and tab marks are displayed.  
- **Color Schemes & Syntax**: Use the ‚ÄúStyle Configurator‚Äù to switch between themes and customize syntax highlighting for each supported language.  
- **File Handling**: Configure options like automatic file reload on changes, behavior with large files, or encoding preferences such as UTF-8.  
- **Security & Backup**: Enable automatic backups or session restore to prevent data loss.  
- **Plugins**: Install and manage extensions via the Plugin Manager to add functionality such as FTP support or advanced formatting.  

These preferences make Notepad++ highly adaptable, whether used for simple text editing or full-scale software development.
