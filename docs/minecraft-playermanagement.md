## Introduction

Manage your players with just a few clicks via the game server administration. Under Player Management you have the possibility to make players operators, add players to the whitelist and ban players who are no longer welcome to the server.

Click on the green button next to the relevant list to add a new player record. During the process, a pop-up window will open in which you must specify the name of the player. 

:::warning Verify name information
Please ensure that you specify the user name correctly, as no check can be performed and otherwise no suitable name will be recognized. 
:::

To remove a player again (revoke operator permissions, unban or remove from the whitelist), you must click on the red button next to the player in the respective list. This will remove the record again. 



## Operators
The Operators list allows you to add the players who should receive administrator permissions.

## Guest list
The guest list (whitelist) allows you to add the players who should be allowed to connect to the server. All players who are not listed will then no longer be able to connect.

## Bans
The banlist allows you to add players who are no longer supposed to be on the server and will therefore be banned.
