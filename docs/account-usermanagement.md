## What is the user administration?

We provide the possibility to create additional sub users. That way you can give your friends access to your services. The advantage of this feature is that there is no need to give your friends access to your main account. Furthermore it' s possible to control the access. 

## How do I activate the user administration?

Click on the arrow to the right of your avatar and select the submenu item **User management**.

At first you have to create a user group, in order to be able to create and assign sub users to the group. Permissions can be defined during the creation of the group. The following permissions options are available:

- General

  - Profile, Support, Order, Offers, Invoices, Refunds, Affiliate, Account, Display orders, Package management, Letters, Reminders, User management

  - Overview, Start settings, Plugins, Backups, Updates, Switch game, Configs, Databases, FTP browser / account, Console

- VPS / Rootserver

 You can create the group with the desired permissions by using the **Create group** button. As soon as the name of the group and the permissions have been set, the sub-user can be added.

Following this, a pop-up window opens where you can add the user. This is where the desired group is assigned and the user name, e-mail address and password specified.

The system then creates a user account and provides the user credentials by e-mail. Using this account information, the subuser can then log in and manage the services with the corresponding permissions.
