## Introduction

The user management allows the creation of sub-users. That way you can give your friends access to your services. The advantage of this feature is that there is no need to give your friends access to your main account. Furthermore it' s possible to control the access. 



## User management configuration

You can find the user administration by clicking on the arrow to the right of your avatar and navigating to the sub-item **User Administration**.

### Step 1 - Create user group

At first you have to create a user group, in order to be able to create and assign sub users to the group. Permissions can be defined during the creation of the group. The following permissions options are available:

- General

  - Profile, Support, Order, Offers, Invoices, Refunds, Affiliate, Account, Display orders, Package management, Letters, Reminders, User management

- Gameserver

  - Overview, Start settings, Plugins, Backups, Updates, Switch game, Configs, Databases, FTP browser / account, Console

- VPS / Root server

  - Overview, Settings, Serial Console, User credentials

 You can create the group with the desired permissions by using the **Create group** button. As soon as the name of the group and the permissions have been set, the sub-user can be added.



### Step 2 - Create user 

Once the user group has been successfully created and configured, you can continue with the creation of the user. Click on the green plus button for this purpose.

A popup window will open where the user is configured and created. Here the desired group is assigned, the user name, e-mail address and password are defined.

:::caution An e-mail address is required which hasn't been used for the registration of a ZAP-Hosting account yet.

The system then creates a user account and provides the user credentials by e-mail. Using this account information, the subuser can then log in and manage the services with the corresponding permissions.
