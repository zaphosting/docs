## Overview

First of all we have to connect to the server.
Here you can find the [Instructions](gameserver_ftpaccess.md)

## Find Locales Files
Once we have done that we look for the script where we want to change the local files.

There we search for the Folder **locales**.

There we look for our localesfile. In our case this is de.lua

If we have changed everything we wanted to change, we save the file and upload it.

## Set Config

After this is done we have to make sure that the correct locales file is specified in the config.

Once this is done we upload the file again and restart the server.
