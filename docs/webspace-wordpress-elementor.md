## Introduction

Elementor is a powerful and user-friendly page builder for WordPress that allows you to easily create professional websites without any coding knowledge.

:::info
Elementor is available in both free and paid versions. With the free version of Elementor (Elementor Core), you get everything you need to get started with your website. Elementor Pro adds to the free version of Elementor and offers additional functions and Pro widgets. You can find more information about the exact differences in the official documentation of **[Elementor](https://elementor.com/help/elementor-pro-vs-free/)**.

## Installation

The use and installation of Elementor requires that you already have WordPress installed and running on your webspace. If this is not yet the case, you will need to take this step first. If you don't know exactly how to do this, we recommend taking a look at our **[Install WordPress](webspace-wordpress.md)** guide. 

As soon as this step has been completed and WordPress is running, you can start installing Elementor. Elementor is installed on WordPress as a plugin. You can find out how to install plugins in WordPress in our [**WordPress Plugins**](webspace-wordpress-plugins.md) guide. 

Navigate to Plugins in WordPress, click on the **Add new plugin** button at the top of the page. In the next step, search for Elementor and click on install in the selection at **Elementor Website Builder - More than just a page builder**.

## Configuration

Now that the installation is complete, you can continue with the configuration. In the next step, you should see the Elementor welcome window. Here you will be guided through the following steps: Creating an Elementor account, installing the “Hello” theme, selecting the desired functions and finally the final confirmation “Good to go”. Simply follow the instructions to fully set up Elementor.

The creation of an Elementor account is not absolutely necessary. Unless you plan to use Elementor Pro directly in advance. Afterwards, you can install the theme and add the additional features you need.

### Templates

Create templates for **containers, pages or sections** that you can use multiple times. The big advantage of this is that changes only have to be made in one place.
