## Availability

The Subdomain feature is available to both new and existing customers. New Customers will have a `xxx`**.zap.cloud** subdomain automatically setup during the installation process. Existing customers will have to enable this manually under the **Settings->DNS Settings** section on the game server's web interface panel. Usage of this section will be covered in the following section.

Not all games are currently supported, but we are pleased to have it already active on a variety of popular games including FiveM, Minecraft and more! In the long-term, we aim to expand this feature across as many games as possible. Unfortunately, certain games make it technically infeasible to add, but for such games you will simply see the IP Address as normal in the web interface.

:::tip
If the game you have installed is not currenly supported, feel free to get in [contact with our Support Team](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/support/) and we will see if we can get this added :)

## Managing Subdomains (DNS)

Managing the subdomain feature on your game server is simple. Head over to the **Settings->DNS Settings** section to begin.

On this page, you will be able to perform a variety of management tasks related to the Free ZAP Cloud subdomain as well as the usage of your own domains that you have setup on your ZAP-Hosting account.

Currently, you can have a maximum of 3 subdomains active per product (not including the randomly generated ZAP Cloud subdomain).
:::

### Random ZAP Cloud Subdomain

In order to generate a random ZAP Cloud subdomain, you must use the **Resolve subdomains** button found on this settings page.

Existing customers should also use this button to generate a random ZAP Cloud subdomain for the first time.

### Custom ZAP Cloud Subdomain

You have the ability to create your very own ZAP Cloud subdomain to suit your needs, by simply inputting the subdomain you wish to use and selecting **.zap.cloud** from the drop down menu (default option).

:::note
If you recieve an error, it is possible that the subdomain is already in use and/or you have entered a banned word or character which is not allowed to protect our customers.
:::

Now use the **Create entry** button and you should be able to see the subdomain appear in the list. You may have to wait up to a few minutes before it becomes fully functional.

### Own Domain

:::info
In order to be able to use your domain to create a subdomain, please ensure that it is associated to your ZAP-Hosting account by [purchasing it on our website](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/domain/), or transferring the domain to your account from another provider.
:::

Creating a subdomain with your own domain follows the same steps as the Custom ZAP Cloud subdomain. Input the subdomain you wish to use and select your own domain from the drop down menu.

:::note
If you recieve an error, it is possible that the subdomain is already in use and/or you have entered a banned word or character which is not allowed to protect our customers.
:::

Now use the **Create entry** button and you should be able to see the subdomain appear in the list. You may have to wait up to a few minutes before it becomes fully functional.

## Troubleshooting

### ZAP Cloud Subdomain

If you are experiencing any issues with the ZAP Cloud subdomains, you can attempt to resolve this yourself by heading over to the **Settings->DNS Settings** section as previously explained, and use the **Resolve subdomains** button found at the bottom.

Please wait a few minutes before checking again if they are functioning correctly.

### Custom Domain

If you cannot see your own domain in the drop down menu when attempting to create a subdomain, this is likely as you do not have it associated with your ZAP-Hosting account.

Please ensure that the domain is active on your ZAP-Hosting account, which may involve transferring it from other providers.

If you are still facing issues regarding any part of the subdomain feature, please contact our Support Team by [creating a ticket on our website](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/support/) and we will be happy to help out.
