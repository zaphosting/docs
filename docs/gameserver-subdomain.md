## Introduction

Our Game Servers now come with a brand new feature that provides you with a convenient ZAP Cloud subdomain that accompanies your traditional IP Address, when the currently installed game is supported.

When activated, you will begin to see an automatic `xxx`**.zap.cloud** subdomain across your web interface, which makes it much more convenient to input for you and your player base when accessing the server and connecting in-game.

You will still be able to see your regular IP Address besides the automatic ZAP Cloud subdomain.

## Availability

This feature is available for both new and existing customers. New Customers will have this feature activated **automatically** when the installed game is supported. Existing customers should proceed with the __next section__ to perform some quick steps to enable this on their server.

In the long-term, we aim to expand this feature across as many games as possible. Unfortunately, certain games make it technically infeasible to add, but for such games you will simply see the IP Address as normal in the web interface.

## Setup for Existing Customers

Activating the new ZAP subdomain feature for your Game Server is simple.

:::info
Only existing customers who own a Game Server with us before `01/07/2024` need to set this up. New Game Servers will be automatically setup with the ZAP Subdomain if the game is supported.

### Main Method
