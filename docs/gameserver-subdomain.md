## Introduction

Our Game Servers now come with a brand new feature that provides you with a convenient ZAP Cloud subdomain that accompanies your traditional IP Address, when the currently installed game is supported.

When activated, you will begin to see an automatic `xxx`**.zap.cloud** subdomain across your web interface, which makes it much more convenient to input for you and your player base when accessing the server and connecting in-game.

You will still be able to see your regular IP Address, besides the automatic ZAP Cloud subdomain.

## Availability

This feature is available for both new and existing customers. New Customers will have this feature activated **automatically** when the installed game is supported. Existing customers should proceed with the __next section__ to perform some quick steps to enable this on their server.

In the long-term, we aim to expand this feature across as many games as possible. Unfortunately, certain games make it technically infeasible to add, but for such games you will simply see the IP Address as normal in the web interface.

## Setup for Existing Customers

Activating the new ZAP subdomain feature for your Game Server is simple.

:::info
Only existing customers who own a Game Server with us before `01/07/2024` need to set this up. New Game Servers will be automatically setup with the ZAP Subdomain if the game is supported.

### Main Method

Simply head over to the **Settings** section on your Game Server's Web Interface panel.

Simply press this button to activate or refresh the ZAP Cloud subdomain.

:::info
It may take up to a few minutes for the subdomain to become visible and active!
:::

:::tip
If you do not see this button, this means that your current game is **not supported** at this time for the ZAP subdomain feature. You are more than welcome to [contact our support](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/support/) to see if we can get this added :)

### Alternative Methods

You can choose to contact our friendly Support Team by [creating a ticket on our website](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/support/) and we will be more than happy to activate the feature for you if it is available for the installed game.

Your Game Server will also have the feature automatically enabled if the game is supported, when you:
- Re-install your Game Server
- Change Game
- Upgrade or Downgrade your Server

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing any issues with the ZAP Cloud subdomain, you can attempt to resolve this yourself by heading over to the **Settings** section on your Game Server's Web Interface panel and using the **Resolve subdomain** button which is found at the bottom.
