To connect to a server, you must start or continue your **Career** in the game. Then click on **Convoy** and call up **Convoy Lobby**. The server list will open, in which you can search for your server using the server name. 

:::warning Server not visible?
If you are unable to find your server using the server name, you can alternatively search for the session search ID in the live console and use this to search for and find your server. Copy the search session ID without the “/101” part.
