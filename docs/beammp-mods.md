## From where do I get mods?
Since BeamMP is built on BeamNG, it can of course use the BeamNG Mods.
There are several locations, from where you could download mods, the official one you can find at beamng.com/resources

## Uploading the data
First of all you need to connect with FTP to your BeamMP-Gameserver. The credentials can be found in "FTP-Browser" in your ZAP Interface.

Connect with a ftp program of your like and open the directory

```
/g*****/beammp/Resources/Client/
```

Upload there the .zip file of your mod.

:::info
After a Server restart, the mod is available and will be downloaded automatically to your client.
