## Install a loading screen

 To install your loading screen, you must first download one from the [FiveM Forums](https://forum.cfx.re/)

You must then rename it to **loadingscreen**.

Now you connect to your Gameserver via FTP and upload it to the resources folder.

As a last step you have to enter it into the Server.cfg. For this you have to go to **Config** once and add it.

There you enter the following **start loadingscreen** and save it afterwards

Now you can start your server and the loadingscreen will show ingame.
