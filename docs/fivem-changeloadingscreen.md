## Preparation

In order to install your own loading screen, you first need to find a suitable resource. You can find a large selection of resources on the official [Cfx.re website](https://forum.cfx.re/c/releases/7). Next, download the resource and unzip it on your computer.

## Installation

The installation of the loading screen is done via FTP. To do this, connect to your game server via FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP yet, please have a look at our [FTP access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) guide. 

Once you are connected via FTP, navigate to the resource folder. Depending on the framework you have installed, you will find your resource folder under the following folder structure: `/gXXXXXX/fivem/YOUR_FRAMEWORK/resources`

Upload the folder from your resource that you previously downloaded and unzipped on your computer to this location.

Now that the loading screen resource has been successfully uploaded, it still needs to be added to the server configuration file `server.cfg`. To do this, log in to the txAdmin interface and open the CFG Editor. 

Then add your resource to the config. You can do this with the `start resourcename` command. In this example, it would be `start loadingscreen`. Save your changes and restart the server afterwards.
