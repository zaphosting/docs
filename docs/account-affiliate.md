## Introduction
Our Affiliate program allows you to earn some free money or ZAP Coins through referring new customers to ZAP-Hosting. You can access this by heading over to the [Affiliate Page](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/affiliate/) on our website.

Through the Affiliate page, you will be able to manage affiliate links, banners and access your dedicated affiliate coupon code which will provide any new customers with an awesome permanent **20% off** their server price for its entire runtime.

## How the Affiliate Program works
You will be able to publish and promote all the affiliate generated content where ever you believe you could gain some traction, for example on your website, a forum or on your social media account. It is entirely up to you.

When someone clicks on the link, and buys a product on our [website](https://zap-hosting.com/), you will be eligible to a sales commission. 

:::tip
The user could also pair their purcahse with your affiliate voucher code during the checkout process to also provide a discount.

## Commissions
Through the Affiliate program, the exact amount of commission depends on the type of product that the person using your link has purchased. It can be as great as **50%** for many products.

You can view the latest and up-to-date commission % values through the [Conditions Section](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/affiliate/conditions/) on the Affiliate Page.

:::info
The affiliate credit display is based on payments including VAT. If you are not a German business/individual who has to add VAT to their invoices, you have to deduct VAT before sending your invoice. This means that you have to deduct the VAT from your displayed affiliate balance when paying out. You can do this by dividing the displayed amount by 1.19 (19% German VAT).

Example: You have €100 affiliate credit. You should invoice: 100 / 1.19 = €84.03 in total. If you pay out in ZAP Coins, you will receive the full amount.

If VAT has to be shown in the invoice, the full amount will be shown in the invoice including VAT. With an affiliate credit of 100€, an invoice of 100€, consisting of €84.03 invoice amount and €15.97 VAT will be sent. Non-German invoices generally will not have to add VAT to the invoice.

## Creating an Affiliate link & banner
To create a new affiliate link or banner, simply head over to the main [Affiliate Page](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/affiliate/) and scroll down. You will be able to view your existing links and banners, but you will also be able to create new ones through the green **Create advertising material** buton.

This will open up a menu in where you will be able to customise a range of values. Firstly, you should pick if you want this to be simply a link or a banner.

Each of the values will be explained in detail below:

#### Alias
In this field, you can specify the unique alias URL ending that should be used for your banner or link. This cannot be duplicate, so it must be available.

For example, specifying `ilovezap` in this field will mean that your banner/link will be accessible through `https://zap-hosting.com/ilovezap`.

If you do not specify your own alias, a random one will be automatically generated for you.

#### Choose a template or linktext
This field is dependant on the type of advertising material you have picked. 

If you picked **banner**, you will have to choose a template. You can do so by using the drop down menu and selecting one of our many default banners that fits your needs and looks.

On the other hand, if you picked **link**, you can specify a linktext which will be used to generate HTML code for your link. For example, if you pick `click this`, the HTML code created will display the text `click me` which is hyperlinked to the affiliate link you are creating. 

You can see this here: `<a href="https://zap-hosting.com/diesisteinaffiliatelink">click me</a>`

#### Selecting the target product
In these fields you can pick a range of options to customise to your own likings where your new affiliate link will redirect to.

We recommend toggling the **Shop products** on because it will lead the customer directly to the server configurator for the selected product, rather than the product page. The fewer pages a user has to go through, increases the likelihood that an order will be placed.

Next you can select the **Product** field using the drop down menu. This is where your new affiliate link will redirect the user to when they access it. If you select a gameserver, you will have an addition **Game** option which you will have to select, otherwise the product is the only option.

#### Finshing the creation process
Once you have filled everything in to your liking, simply press the green **Create** button to proceed in creating your banner or link. You should receive an success message if everything is correct, and your new banner or link will appear under the **Your Banners/Links** section once you scroll down.
