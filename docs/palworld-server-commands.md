## Setting up Admin

You must first set an admin password for your Palword server and add yourself as an admin in-game before being able to access the admin server commands in the next section.

You can set your server's admin password through the **Settings** tab on your server's webinterface or via the **PalWorldSettings.ini** configuration file. Once set, you can use the `/AdminPassword [password]` command in-game to add yourself as admin.

:::tip
We highly recommend that you take a look at our [Palworld Setup Admin guide](palworld-admin.md) which is a dedicated guide for this topic and provides more in-depth details regarding setting an admin password and adding users as admin.
