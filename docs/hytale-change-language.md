## Introduction

If you are looking for your preferred language in Hytale, you may be hoping to improve your overall experience on a server by playing in a language you are more comfortable with. Especially during Early Access, understanding menus, items, quests, and system messages can make a significant difference when exploring the game or playing on multiplayer servers.

As of now Hytale only supports English as its official language during the Early Access phase. The developers have confirmed that additional languages are planned for the future, but they are not yet available in the current version of the game. Hytale has stated the following regarding language support:

> **Will the game be available in my local language?**
> *“Initially, Hytale will only be available in English, but the game is already built with localization in mind. We had a very good experience with Crowdin, so with the community's help, we can create an amazing localized experience for everyone. Maybe a few of you even want to bring back Pirate-Speak… YARRRR!!”*

Since Hytale currently only supports English by default, additional languages are provided by the community through language packs. These language packs are usually distributed as mods and can be downloaded from platforms such as CurseForge. There is currently no way to change the language on the server level. However, this can be achieved through the game client. 


## Installing language pack

Since Hytale currently only supports English by default, additional languages are provided by the community through language packs. These language packs are usually distributed as mods and can be downloaded from platforms such as CurseForge.

To install a language pack, first download the desired language mod from CurseForge and make sure it is compatible with your current Hytale version. After downloading, place the mod file into the local Hytale mods directory on your computer.

Once the language pack is placed in the correct folder, start or restart the Hytale client. Next, open the game settings, navigate to G and select your newly added language.
