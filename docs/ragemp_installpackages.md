## Connect via FTP

Before packages can be installed, the [FTP-Access](gameserver_ftpaccess.md) must be set up:

## RageMP Packages

RageMP packages are extensions or modifications. 
RageMP distinguishes between "**Client**" and "**Server**" packages

### Client packages

Client-side packages are used to edit the in-game user interface or other visual effects.
The client-side packages are uploaded to the "**client_packages**" folder

In this folder a "**gamemode**" folder and a "**index.js**" file will be created.
The "**index.js**" file is important as soon as all scripts have been uploaded.

In the "**gamemode**" folder the scripts are uploaded, which you want to use on the server.

As soon as all desired scripts have been uploaded, the previously created "**index.js**" must be edited.
There for each script the line ***require(./gamemode/DEINSCRIPTNAME.js);*** is inserted

### Server packages

Server side packages are used to edit basic settings from the server.
For example: Spawn, players, cars, markers

The server side packages are uploaded to the "**packages**" folder

In this folder another folder will be created, the name of this folder is freely selectable.

Once the folder is created, this folder will be filled with the server-side scripts.

After all desired scripts are on the server a "**index.js**" must be created in the same folder.

There for each script the line ***require(./DEINSCRIPTNAME.js);*** is inserted

The "**Client**" as well as "**Server**" packages should be active directly on the server after a server restart
