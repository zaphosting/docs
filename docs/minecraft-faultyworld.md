## Introduction

Your world is partially overloaded or buggy and this limits gameplay so you can no longer play properly? This can be the case if there are too many items in certain areas of your world or if it generally contains damaged chunks. A Chunk Error is a somewhat common glitch in Minecraft which occurs when a chunk loads incorrectly.

## Preparation

There are various tools that can be used to modify Minecraft worlds. One of the most common tools is [MCA Selector](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector), which will be used for this guide. To do this, download the `MCA_Selector_Setup.exe` file.

Apart from that, you need the files from your world on your computer. The world can be downloaded via FTP. If you are not familiar with the use of FTP, then we recommend that you take a look at our [Access via FTP](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) guide. Download the `world` directory from the game server directory. 



## Load world

Once you have downloaded the tool and the world, you can now import the world into the tool. To do this, click in the tool in the navigation on `File -> Open World`. Following this, you should see your world as shown in our example.

Depending on the coordinates, you may first have to zoom out with the mouse to find the relevant area.

## Remove chunk(s)
You can select individual boxes (chunks) with a mouse click. Search and select the chunks which are problematic for you and should be deleted. Then click on `Selection -> Delete selected Chunks` in the navigation.

As a result, the selected chunks have been deleted and you can now upload the world to your server again via FTP. 

## Conclusion
Congratulations, you have successfully removed the faulty chunks and should be able to play this world properly again. For further questions or assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact our support team, which is available daily to assist you! ðŸ™‚
