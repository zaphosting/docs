## Preface

Thanks to our cloud system, you can always modify your ZAP-Hosting game server according to your wishes and needs.
For example, if you need more slots or more RAM, this is not a problem and can be adjusted at any time.
Please keep in mind, if you have used a voucher, a downgrade is no longer possible, in the voucher period.

## How it works

When you change your package, the remaining term will always be recalculated, so assuming you want to upgrade your server, you will have to pay the additional price for the remaining term.
Your product price will also change automatically to the next renewal, regarding your new conditions.
Please keep in mind that unfortunately coupons cannot be applied to upgrades, they only apply to new orders.

## Upgrades

You can always find the Up-/Downgrade Manager on the dashboard of your product, it doesn't matter what kind of product it is.
Upgrades are currently possible for all products except Dedicated Servers.

The upgrade/downgrade manager is displayed in the left menu of your product dashboard:

### Upgrade options

Once in our manager, you will find the parameters of your product that can be customized.

For gameservers, it is possible to move them between different locations.

*** 

* Gameserver Slot: If you need more capacity on your game server, just move the slider to the left to have more space for simultaneous players.

* RAM Boost: Useful for many things like resources, mods, add-ons or similar. Expands the capacity of the available RAM of your product.

* CPU & Hostserver: If you need more performance, you can switch to a premium system, which brings you the corresponding performance boost.

* IP Address: If you need a constant IP which will not change again as long as the product exists, you need this option.

:::info
⚠ The own IP address is not to be confused with a domain, an own IP is also randomly assigned and cannot be modified.
