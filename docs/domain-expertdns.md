## Introduction

With the **ExpertDNS function** you can set which name servers should be used for the domain.

## Where do I find the ExpertDNS option and how do I use it?

The option is displayed in the domain administration page. **EasyDNS** would be selected by default in there, so you must first check "**expertDNS Activate**"

As soon as activated, further name servers can now be entered there. 
The changes are confirmed with "**Save**".
