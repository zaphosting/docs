## Changing the autosave interval

To change the autosave interval, open the management interface for your StarRupture game server in your hosting panel. Navigate to the **Settings** section of your server configuration.

Within the settings page, locate the option labeled **Save Interval**. This value defines how frequently the server creates automatic world saves.

Adjust the interval to your preferred value and save the changes. Once applied, the server will use the new autosave interval for all future automatic saves.
