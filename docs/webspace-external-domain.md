## Link domain in Plesk

Before you can link your external domain to your webspace, you first need to add the domain in **Plesk**. To do this, add your domain under the **Hosting Settings** section. If youâ€™re not sure how to do this yet, you can find detailed instructions in our [Add Domain](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/docs/webspace-adddomain) guide.

## Configure the DNS settings

To connect your external domain to your ZAP-Hosting webspace, you first need to adjust the DNS settings at the provider where your domain is registered. For your website and emails to work properly, your domain must know which server to direct visitors and mail traffic to. This is done by creating the required DNS records.

You will need the IP address of your webspace instance to set up the A records. You can find this information directly in your ZAP webspace dashboard.

Once you have the IP address, you can add the necessary DNS records at your domain provider. These include A records to point your domain to your webspace, as well as MX and TXT records to handle email delivery and domain verification.

For more detailed information about how the different types of DNS records work and what their purpose is, we recommend taking a look at our [Domain Records](domain-records.md) guide.

Below is a table listing all required DNS records for your setup:

| Name                           | Type | Value                           | TTL  | Prio |
| ------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| *                              | A    | IP address of webspace instance | 3600 | 0    |
| mail                           | A    | IP address of webspace instance | 3600 | 0    |
| www                            | A    | IP address of webspace instance | 3600 | 0    |
| domain.tld.                    | A    | IP address of webspace instance | 3600 | 0    |
| domain.tld.                    | MX   | v=DKIM1;k=rsa;p=MIIBIjA......   | 3600 | 10   |

| _dmarc.domain.tld.             | TXT  | v=DMARC1; p=none                | 3600 | 0    |

:::warning DNS Changes May Take Time

Changes to your DNS settings can take up to 24 hours to fully propagate worldwide. During this time, your domain might not immediately point to your new webspace or email services, so please be patient while the changes take effect.
