### Edit rDNS

Adjust the reverse DNS entry (PTR record) for your server’s IP address to point to the correct hostname. A properly configured rDNS helps ensure that your server’s VPS name resolves correctly and is especially important for running a mail server. Without a valid rDNS, outgoing emails may be marked as spam or fail to deliver reliably.

### VNC-Console

With the VNC Console you can interact with your server as if you were directly at the machine. This remote access lets you control the screen, keyboard and mouse, so you can perform maintenance tasks even if there is no active network connection. It’s ideal for repairing network settings or solving configuration problems.
