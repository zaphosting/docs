## Introduction

When technical issues occur on the website, certain session information can help identify the cause more efficiently. This information is generated automatically during use and allows support to better understand what happened within a specific session. It enables a more precise analysis of errors such as loading problems, non-responsive interface elements or unexpected messages. The session information is anonymous and does not contain personal data.


## Purpose of the Session Information

A unique session identifier is created while navigating the ZAP-Hosting website. It provides context for technical actions taking place in the background and helps interpret irregular behavior. This improves the accuracy of the troubleshooting process and allows support to focus on the relevant technical details of the affected session.



## Use in Support Requests

If you experience issues on the website, support may ask you to provide this session identifier. Supplying it enables a targeted review of the technical events associated with your session. This reduces the need for follow-up questions, speeds up diagnostics and supports faster resolution of the reported problem.



## Display of the Session Information

The session identifier is shown in the footer of the website. It is automatically refreshed when a new session begins, for example after logging out or when cookies are reset. Example Session identifier: `abcd1234efgh5678`

## Function Behind the Scenes

All relevant technical operations of the session are linked to the identifier. This allows support staff to isolate session-specific information when investigating an issue, resulting in a clearer and more efficient analysis process.
