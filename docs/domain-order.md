## Introduction

Here at ZAP-Hosting, we offer a wide variety of popular domains including gTLD's such as `.com` and `.net`, that you can order directly through our [Domain configurator](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/domain/). In this guide, we will explore the order process in-depth.

## Ordering a New Domain

You can order your very own domain [directly here](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/domain/). On the page, use the search bar to enter the domain name that you wish to own and press search.

The website will now return the availability of each domain for the given name, making it easy to find one that is available. If a domain is not available, this means that someone else already owns it and thus you cannot order it.

## Domain Information

Domains are always priced in **1 Year** increments and must be renewed before the expiry date, otherwise you may risk it being lost.

During the order process, you will have to truthfully provide a range of personal information including your first name, surname and address. These fields are private and only the registrar and authorities can access this data if absolutely necessary.

:::info
With GDPR rules in place across the EU, all the information that you provide alongside the domain will be private and cannot be accessed publicly.

:::caution 
Please be aware that some domain endings may be subject to country-specific or regional registration policies. Certain domains are subject to restrictions on who may register them - depending on factors such as place of residence, company headquarters or other legal requirements. Please check the applicable regulations of the respective domain registry before registering.
