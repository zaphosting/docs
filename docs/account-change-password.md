## Introduction

If you want to change the password of your ZAP-Hosting account, you can do so at any time via your account settings. This guide shows you how to change your current password or reset it if you’ve forgotten it.

## Change Password

If you still know your current password and simply wish to change it, you can do this directly in your account settings. Start by logging into your account at [ZAP-Hosting](https://zap-hosting.com). Once logged in, click on the arrow right next to your username located in the top-right corner of the interface. From the dropdown menu, select **Change password**.

A pop-up window will appear in which you can change your password. To do this, you must provide the old password and then the new password, which you must then confirm again for security reasons. Complete the process by clicking on **Change password**.
