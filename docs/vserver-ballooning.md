## Introduction

**Ballooning** is a technology used for **dynamic memory management** in virtualized environments. It allows the hypervisor to flexibly allocate physical RAM between the different virtual machines (VMs) based on their current memory requirements.

This process is handled by a **balloon driver** inside the virtual machine, which communicates directly with the hypervisor. When the system detects that some virtual machines are using less memory than allocated, the hypervisor can temporarily reclaim unused memory by inflating the balloon in those VMs. This freed memory is then made available to other machines that currently need more.



## Advantages of ballooning

Ballooning is not just about optimizing memory usage for a single server. It plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced and stable environment for all customers on the host system. By dynamically managing memory across all virtual machines, the host can react even more effectively to changing workloads. This helps prevent bottlenecks and ensures smooth operation even during peak times.

As a customer, you benefit directly from this system-wide optimization. Ballooning helps maintain consistent stability even when multiple services are active at the same time. It ensures that memory is always available where it is actually needed, improving the overall responsiveness of your server. Unused memory in one instance does not remain idle but is made available to other processes if required.

This approach leads to a more reliable infrastructure where all customers enjoy smoother performance. Ballooning is a recommended and proven standard setting for the vast majority of server workloads. Deactivation is only recommended if you run highly specialized memory-critical applications. These include workloads that require exclusive physical memory allocation without any form of dynamic management such as certain real-time databases or specific low-latency applications.



## Configure ballooning

If your application requires fixed and guaranteed memory without dynamic adjustments, you can disable ballooning directly in your **Server Dashboard** under **Settings â†’ Disable ballooning**. Restart the server via the web interface afterwards to apply the change.

For typical server usage, however, we strongly recommend keeping ballooning enabled. This ensures that your server remains stable and responsive while also contributing to an efficient and fair distribution of resources across the entire host system.

:::warning Ballooning option missing?

If you do not see the option to disable ballooning in your server settings, this means your server is still running on **LXC virtualization**. We have recently switched to offering all new virtual server products based on **KVM virtualization**, which provides more advanced features.

If you would like to switch your server to **KVM**, you can simply perform a **reinstallation** from the server management panel. During the reinstallation process, your server will automatically be recreated on **KVM virtualization**.
