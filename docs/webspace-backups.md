## Introduction

Backups of a webspace are like a backup copy of your website. If something goes wrong, for example due to an error, you can use a backup to restore everything without losing your progress. A backup allows you to save all relevant components of your website, including important configuration settings, email communication, website content and databases, allowing you to restore them if necessary.


## Create manual Backups

Select the website (domain) from which you would like to create a backup. Navigate to the Dashboard section and click on **Backup and restore**. When creating the backup, you can select what should be backed up. You can choose between the options **Configuration**, **E-mail messages**, **User files** and **Databases**.

In the next step, you can select whether the backup should be stored locally or externally. An external server with FTP access is required for external storage. You could, for example, use your **[Storage Server](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/home/storage/)** for this.

## Create automatic Backups

Along with the option of creating manual backups, automatic backups can also be created. This allows a backup to be created automatically at specific times. Choose between daily, weekly or monthly backups. If you wish, you can also select whether only newly changed data should be backed up or whether a complete backup should be created.

## Manage Backups

### Import

To import a backup, click on the link under Creation date in the backup. The next step will take you to the import process. Once there, you can now select what you want to import from the backup content. You have the choice between **Selected objects** and **All objects (entire system)**:

- **Selected objects:** Select a single object that you specifically want to import. You can choose from: Database, SSL/TLS certificates, websites, DNS zone, files from domains
- **All objects (entire system):** Imports a complete backup containing all objects (database, SSL/TLS certificates, websites, DNS zone, domain files). 



### Download

Would you like to save your backup locally as well? That's no problem. You can also download the created backups directly to your computer. To do this, open the Backup Manager again and click on the green arrow pointing downwards next to the backup you want to download.
