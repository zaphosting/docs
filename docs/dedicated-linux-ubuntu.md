## Preparations

In your ZAP interface, select the desired ISO of Ubuntu and let the server boot with the ISO until it is in the setup process.

:::info
Navigation in the setup process is done with the keys TAB, Space and Enter.

`TAB` = switch between items, `Space` = highlight, `Enter` = confirm

The adapter `eno1` is the default network adapter of your ZAP Dedicated Server.

We proceed by ticking "Done"

Our dedicated servers are located in Germany, so it's recommended to choose the German mirror location to achieve the best possible download speed rates.

In this step you can create different partitions for your system, if you'd like to use just the whole ssd as one partition just pick "Use an entire disk"

The setup automatically creates the volumes and you can proceed by choosing "Done"

The setup, of course, deletes all persisting data on the system, we accept that by ticking "Continue" and pressing enter.

Ubuntu offers a few default snaps, if you'd like to use some of them, just tick the ones your like.

Please eject now the ISO File in your iLO to prevent the server from loading the setup again.

choose "Reboot now" and verify by pressing enter that you have removed the ISO file.

## Changing the password of the root user
You can easily change the password of the root user:

Write `sudo su`, and enter your password; then write `sudo passwd` to change the password.
Now enter the new desired password for the root user.

That's it - You can now login with your user account `root`
