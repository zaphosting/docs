## Introduction

FiveM upvotes give you the opportunity to have your own or another server placed higher in the server list. The more active upvote points a server has, the higher it will be ranked.

## How do I get Upvotes?

The FiveM Upvotes can be purchased in [our store](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/fivem-upvotes/). During the order process you have the possibility to choose the amount of upvotes, runtime, FiveM username and billing method. 

:::info
**Attention:** FiveM Upvotes can not be paid with ZAP Coins as it is an external product. The order can only be placed through a proper payment method like PayPal or credit card. Exceptions are not possible here.

For the use of the FiveM upvotes it is necessary to link your FiveM account. The upvotes will be assigned to this account, which you can then use to assign the upvotes in game according to your wishes.

Once this has been confirmed, the order can be completed. The information will then immediately be forwarded to FiveM and processed there. As soon as this process has been completed, the upvotes are available to you and can be managed via the interface. The runtime of the upvotes also starts at this point. 



## Assign Upvotes

As soon as the upvotes are visible in the interface, they can be assigned via the FiveM client. To do this, click on the Upvotes icon in the server list for the server of your choice.

As a confirmation, a pop-up should now open confirming that the upvotes have been successfully assigned.

## Reset Upvotes

In case the upvotes should be reassigned to another server or an error occurred while assigning the upvotes, they can be reset via the dashboard.

The reset of the upvotes can take a few minutes. They can usually be reassigned after 60 minutes at the latest.
