## Introduction
Do you want to generate your world quickly, efficiently and safely in advance, rather than during gameplay? Minecraft does not offer an integrated function for this by default. However, this can be realized with specially designed plugins or mods. How to use these and what aspects you need to consider are explained in more detail below.



## Prerequisites

First of all, you must ensure that your server is designed for the use of plugins or mods. The use of one of the following Minecraft variants is required for use: 

- Minecraft: Forge, Minecraft Fabric (mods)
- Minecraft: Spigot, Minecraft Bukkit, Minecraft: Paper Spigot (plugins) 

If you are currently not using any of these Minecraft variants, you can use the [game switch(gameserver-gameswitch.md) option to select the desired game.


## Installation
The most common method for generating chunks in advance is to use [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky), which is available for numerous server implementations both as a plugin and in a mod version. In this example, chunk generation is explained and demonstrated by using Chunky.

| Variant | Download |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mod | [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunky-pregenerator-forge) [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunky-pregenerator) |
| Plugin | [Spigot/Bukkit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/) |

Download **Chunky** either as a plugin or mod and install it on your server. If you don't know exactly how to install [Plugins](minecraft-pluginuploader.md) or [Mods](minecraft-forge-fabric-add-mods-modpacks), the corresponding guides will help you.




## Use 

Once **Chunky** has been successfully installed, you can start generating the chunks. The process can be started with the command `chunky start`.

In case you want to interrupt the generation temporarily and continue later, you can do this with the commands `chunky pause` and `chunky continue`. To end the process completely, use `chunky cancel`. You can execute the commands either via the live console or as an operator directly in game on your server.

:::warning Excessive load
A permanent exceeding of the resource limits over a longer period of time can lead to a temporary suspension. To avoid this, chunk generation should take place at a balanced pace and scope so that the system load remains within an acceptable range.

Further information on resource limits and possible measures can be found in our [resource limit](gameserver-resourcelimit.md) guide.
