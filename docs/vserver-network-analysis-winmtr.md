## Introduction

Network problems can be disruptive and, of course, should not be part of everyday life. However, when they do occur, it is important to quickly and efficiently identify the cause in order to resolve the issue. Detailed information about network problems can be effectively analyzed using the **WinMTR (Windows)** or **MTR (Linux/Mac OS)** application.

![img](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/RecNoSB7J7A7B72/preview)

WinMTR/MTR is a network diagnostic tool that combines the functions of Ping and Traceroute. It allows for detailed analysis of both the **outbound route (Client → Server)** and the **return route (Server → Client)** by tracking the path of data packets in both directions. In doing so, it captures important information such as latency and packet loss, which are crucial for accurately diagnosing and addressing network problems.

**Outbound route (Client → Server)**: A report for the **outbound route** is useful when issues such as connection drops, slow connections, or difficulties establishing connections arise. This analysis helps identify potential problems on the path from the client to the server, such as network congestion, packet loss, or faulty routing.

**Return route (Server → Client)**: A report for the **return route** only makes sense once a stable and functional connection on the outbound route has been confirmed. This means the return route report becomes particularly relevant when the outbound route shows no issues, but problems such as slow server responses, delayed loading times, or incomplete data transmissions still persist.

In summary, if noticeable network problems occur, the **outbound route (Client → Server)** should be analyzed first. If the outbound report shows no anomalies and the issues persist, it is necessary to check the **return route (Server → Client)** to identify possible asymmetric problems. Asymmetric network issues can arise when data packets are transmitted without problems in one direction, while delays or packet loss occur in the opposite direction.



## Installation
Now that it has been clarified when reports for the inbound and outbound routes are useful, we can move on to the installation on both the client and server levels.

### Client
For the outbound route, the application must be installed on the client (**your computer**). The following steps will explain how to install the application for your operating system.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

## Evaluate report

When evaluating the results, there are several key points you should keep in mind. The following section will explain these points in more detail and clarify their significance for the analysis. Paying close attention to these aspects is crucial for making an accurate diagnosis and identifying potential causes effectively.

### Packet loss

If you see packet loss in the results, this indicates potential network problems. A minor temporary packet loss of 1-2% might not be problematic, but higher values suggest more serious issues. Packet loss can cause delays or interruptions in the services' connections. If the loss is evenly distributed across all hops, the problem could lie within your own network or on the server side. However, if the loss occurs only at a specific hop or area, the issue is likely with that node or the connection to the next one. It's also important to know that small losses in the first hops, which belong to your local network, are not necessarily critical, as these devices often prioritize ICMP requests (such as ping) lower and may discard them.



### Latency (ping times)
The latency values (`Avg`, `Best`, `Worst`) give you insight into the speed and stability of the connection. If you notice that latency remains consistently high at a particular hop, this could indicate network congestion or a slow router. A sudden increase in latency between two hops points to a possible bottleneck. Normally, latency gradually increases along the route to the destination. However, be on the lookout for sudden, significant spikes, which are often a sign of an issue. Comparing the outbound and return routes can also be helpful in identifying asymmetric problems, which indicate that traffic in one direction is encountering difficulties.

With careful analysis of these factors, you can accurately determine where the network problem lies—whether in your own network, with the internet service provider, or somewhere along the path to the server.



### Diagnostic examples 
To enhance your understanding, let's clarify the previous information with a few diagnostic examples. We have compiled a few scenarios that illustrate different situations and possible causes. These examples will help demonstrate how to interpret the data and diagnose network issues more effectively.

**Evaluation**

The evaluation shows that there is a routing issue with the ISP. While the route from Client X to the server is stable, the route from Client Y exhibits significant problems, resulting in packet loss and high latency.

<TabItem value="mtrResultsExample6" label="Example 6">

**Example:** Packet Loss Only on the Outbound Route (Client → Server)

**Description**

In this example, packet loss occurs only on the outbound route (from the client to the server), while the return route (from the server to the client) shows no loss. This could indicate a problem in a network segment toward the server, possibly caused by faulty routers, congestion, or a poor connection along the path.

**Evaluation**

The evaluation shows that packet loss occurs exclusively on the outbound route. The losses are visible at hops 4, 5, and 6, indicating a problem along the path from the client to the server, such as congestion or faulty network devices in a segment of the route. On the return route, however, there are no losses, meaning the connection in the opposite direction is stable.
