## Introduction

Rcon is a protocol for executing commands on the server without having direct access to the console.

## Preparation

A suitable Rcon tool is required for the use. For example, the well-known Rcon tool Icecon can be used for this. This example is based on Icecon. The tool can be set up by downloading and executing the icecon_windows_amd64.exe.

An additional installation is not required. The program can be started right away. To establish the connection, the information about the IP address, port and rcon password is required.

## Configuration
The rcon password can be defined in the server config. The value of the following command must be adjusted for this:
```
rcon_password "YourDesiredRconPassword"
```



## Usage

Once the password has been defined and the server has been restarted, the rcon connection can be established. To do this, complete the two fields IP:Port and Password (Rcon) with the information from your server and click on "OK".
