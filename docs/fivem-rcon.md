## What is Rcon?

Rcon is a protocol for executing commands on the server without having direct access to the console.

### Preparation

A suitable Rcon tool is required for the use. For example, the well-known Rcon tool Icecon can be used for this. This example is based on Icecon. The tool can be set up by downloading and executing the icecon_windows_amd64.exe.

An additional installation is not required. The program can be started right away. To establish the connection, the information about the IP address, port and rcon password is required.

### Define rcon password

**Configuration via the settings**

With the FiveM server products "FiveM (Linux/Windows/ESX RP Server/QBCore)" the rcon password can be defined under the settings by default. The password defined there is then required for the following rcon connection via Icecon.

**Configuration via the server config**

The rcon password can alternatively also be set directly via the server config. The value of the following command must be adjusted for this:
```
rcon_password "DeinWunschRconPasswort"
```

:::info
To manage it via the server config, the option of the rcon field must first be deactivated under the settings. 


**txAdmin:** The definition of the rcon password is only possible via the server config for txAdmin.

### Usage

Once the password has been defined and the server has been restarted, the rcon connection can be established. To do this, complete the two fields IP:Port and Password (Rcon) with the information from your server and click on "OK".

The connection will be established afterwards and you can now execute your desired commands there!
