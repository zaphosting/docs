## Introduction
The assignment of administrator permissions allows you simple and comprehensive administration with full control of your server. As an administrator, you have the option of using all available options and functions provided by the game directly in the game. All the steps you need to take to assign administrator permissions for your server will be described below.

## Locate Steam64ID

Firstly, you would need to locate your Steam64ID.
You can use the following tool: [SteamID Lookup](https://steamid.io/lookup).
The ID will later be entered in the configuration file.

Here you can find an example of how you can get your steamid by inputting your profile link there:

## Configure adminconfig

The "**adminconfig.yaml**" which must be edited is located in the "**Saves**" directory.
To open this directory, the instructions for the [Access via FTP](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) must be followed.

The ranks are assigned as follows:
