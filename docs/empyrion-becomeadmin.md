## Locate Steam64ID

Firstly, you would need to locate your Steam64ID.
You can use the following tool: [SteamID Lookup](https://steamid.io/lookup).
The ID will later be entered in the configuration file.

Here you can find an example of how you can get your steamid by inputting your profile link there:

## Configure adminconfig

The "**adminconfig.yaml**" which must be edited is located in the "**Saves**" directory.
To open this directory, the instructions for the [FTP connection](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/docs/en/gameserver_ftpaccess) must be followed.

The previously selected Steam64ID must now be written after "**Id:**".

With "**Permission**" the rank is determined, which should be given to the user.
The ranks are assigned as follows:

Permission | Rank
