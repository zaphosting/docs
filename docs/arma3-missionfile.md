## Upload the mission file

For uploading your own mission file you have to connect to your server via FTP before: [Access via FTP](gameserver-ftpaccess.md).
There you have to upload the mission file into your **mpmissions** directory which you can find under **/gxxxxxx/arma3/**.
In this example we upload the mission file **King_of_the_hill.Altis** to our server.
