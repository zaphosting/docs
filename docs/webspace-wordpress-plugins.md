## Installation

Begin by logging in to the WordPress dashboard and navigate to the **Plugins** menu item in the sidebar. Once there, identify the **Add New** button at the top and press it.

A new page will open, bringing you to the plugin overview. On this page, you can browse through the listed plugins, sorted by Featured, Popular, Recommended, and Favorites. On the right-hand side, youâ€™ll find a search bar where you can also search for a specific plugin.

## Updates

Your plugins should always be kept up to date. WordPress makes this task much easier for you. When an update is available, WordPress displays it directly in your plugin list and you can install it with one click. WordPress takes care of minor updates automatically. For larger and manual updates, however, it is advisable to create a backup of your website and database in advance. 

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have successfully installed your first WordPress plugin. If you have any further questions or problems, please contact our support team, who are available to help you every day!
