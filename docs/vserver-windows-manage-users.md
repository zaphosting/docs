## Introduction

Windows OS provides built-in user management allowing you to easily manage additional users. Some of the benefits of using individual users include simulataneous (up to 2) remote desktop access through own credentials, individual desktop and file access as well as an easy permission system. In this guide, we will cover the process of managing users on your Windows server.

## Prerequisites

Begin by connecting to your Windows server via RDP. If you need help doing this, please refer to our [Initial Access (RDP)](vserver-windows-userdp.md) guide.

:::important Administrative Privileges
Ensure that you use the **Administrator** user or any user with administrative privileges  to login to your Windows server, otherwise you will not be able to manage users.
:::

Each user that you create on your Windows server, will be able to use their own credentials to connect to the server through Remote Desktop. Similarly, each user will have their very own desktop, files and programs which are independent of others and can only be viewed by any user with administrative privileges . Programs that were installed for all users specifically, will be accessible globally.

With the regular Windows Server license, **2** accounts will be able to login and use the server simultanously. If this is exceeded and another user connects, the user that connected first will be disconnected in favour of the connecting user. Otherwise, there is no limit to how many user accounts can be created.

## Accessing User Management

Managing user accounts is done through the settings via the Control Panel. Begin by opening the Windows start menu on your Windows server and selecting **Control Panel**. Select the **User Accounts** option which should take you to another sub-menu.

Lastly, you will have to add the new user to the remote desktop connection list to ensure that the server accepts RDP connections from it. Head over to the **Control Panel** and access **System and Security**.

This will expand the window to make your user easy to find. Use the **Find Now** button to return a list of users and find your new user, in this example this is `ZAP-Docs`.

Select the user and use the **OK** buttons to close all the menus down and confirm changes.

You can easily manage all users through the **Manage Accounts** section. Simply select a user that you wish to manage.
