## Introduction

Managing your domain is important, including the ability to transfer your domain across providers. In this guide, we will explore how you can transfer your existing domain, both to and from your ZAP-Hosting account.

## Transferring Domain to ZAP-Hosting

Transferring a domain to your ZAP-Hosting account is simple. Begin by heading over to the [Domain configurator page](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/domain/) whilst logged in and search for your existing domain.

In order to transfer a domain, you will have to extend it by 1 Year during the order process.

Once you find the exact domain you wish to transfer, select it from the list. It is normal for the domain to show as unavailable, but you should see the transfer icon besides.

This will open up a new prompt which is used to authorize the transfer to your ZAP-Hosting account.

You will now have go to your existing registrar and request the **Auth Code** for your domain. Typically, more popular registrars will have an automated system to let you easily request the authorization code, for example through filling out a form or your customer dashboard. If in doubt, you should contact your registrar's support team.

Once you have the **Auth Code** ready, input it into the prompt and confirm it. Proceed as normal with the order process.

With your order now submitted, your transfer request should be typically completed within 48 hours. However, this process may sometimes take longer than this as your old provider has to approve the transfer first, so we ask you to please be patient during this process :)

If there is an issue with the order, for example issues with the Auth Code, we will contact you as soon as possible to have this resolved promptly.

## Transferring Domain away from ZAP-Hosting

We are sad to see you consider moving your domain away from us, but we respect our customers and thus we have made transferring your domain away from us just as simple.

Head over to the **Dashboard** area on your Domain's web interface panel. On this page, you will be able to directly view your current active **Auth Code** for the domain.

You should provide this authorization code to your new provider during setup to move your domain.
