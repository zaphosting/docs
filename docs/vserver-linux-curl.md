## Introduction

cURL  is both a free command-line tool and a software library (libcURL) for transferring data using URLs. It supports a wide range of protocolsâ€”including HTTP(S), FTP, SMTP, LDAP, MQTT, and moreâ€”and is commonly used for tasks such as downloading files, testing APIs, and automating network operations.  

Considering about hosting this service yourself? Weâ€™ll walk you through every step on how to set it up and configure it, along with everything you need to keep in mind.

## Preparation

Before setting up the **cURL**, you need to prepare your system. This includes updating your operating system to the latest version. These preparations ensure a stable environment and help prevent issues during or after the installation.


### Update System
To make sure your system is running with the most recent software and security improvements, you should always perform system updates first. To do this, run the following command:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
This ensures that your system has the latest security patches and software versions before proceeding.



## Installation

Now that the necessary preparations have been completed, you can proceed with the installation of the cURL application. To do so, execute the following command: 

```console
sudo apt install curl  -y
```



## Configuration

cURL does not require traditional configuration but can be customized through a configuration file. This file allows you to define default options that will be applied automatically with every execution. Common examples include:

- `--user-agent "MyAgent/1.0"` to specify a custom user agent  
- `--silent` to suppress progress bars or extra output  
- `--insecure` to disable SSL certificate checks (only recommended for testing)  
- `--header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"` for API authentication  

In addition, environment variables like `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` can be set to route cURL requests through a proxy server. This setup makes cURL more efficient for repetitive tasks by avoiding the need to retype long command options every time.
