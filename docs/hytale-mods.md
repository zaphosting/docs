## Introduction

Mods turn your Hytale server into something truly your own. They can add new mechanics, expand existing systems, introduce fresh challenges, and create entirely new ways to play, from small quality of life improvements to complete gameplay overhauls.

Whether you want faster progression, deeper survival elements, more building options, custom events, or unique server rules, mods give you the tools to shape the experience and set your world apart.

:::info Early Access Notice

Hytale released on January 13th, 2026 and is currently available in Early Access. As the game is still in an active development phase, server software, configuration files, modding support, and installation workflows may continue to change over time.

## Install Mods

Mods can be installed by adding them directly to your server files. Start by downloading the desired mods in `.zip` or `.jar` format from trusted sources such as CurseForge.

Once downloaded, connect to your server and open the `mods/` directory in the server root. Upload the mod files into this folder without extracting or modifying them. After all mods are in place, restart the server so they are loaded and activated.
