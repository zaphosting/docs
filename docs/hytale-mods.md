## Introduction

Mods turn your Hytale server into something truly your own. They can add new mechanics, expand existing systems, introduce fresh challenges, and create entirely new ways to play, from small quality of life improvements to complete gameplay overhauls.

Whether you want faster progression, deeper survival elements, more building options, custom events, or unique server rules, mods give you the tools to shape the experience and set your world apart.
