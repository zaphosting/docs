## What's the partner system?
You have a YouTube channel, stream on Twitch or run a gaming clan? Then you can apply as a partner. Our partners advertise ZAP-Hosting on their channels and in return they can get for example **free servers, hardware** or **server** for raffles or **money**.

## How do I apply as a partner?

To apply as a partner, just click on the field "**Apply now**" on our [partner site](https://zap-hosting.com/en/partner/) and fill out the application. 

## Who is the partner program for?
The partner program is aimed at:
- Content Creators
- gaming clans
- eSports Clans
- gaming communities
- Blogs and forums
- Game developers

It is important that your channel has a certain minimum reach and that your target group is interested in game servers. For example, if you have a YouTube channel that shows Minecraft videos, then you're perfect for our affiliate program. Makeup tips, on the other hand, are not very interesting for our affiliate program.

## How high should my range be?

As an affiliate, you should have a certain amount of reach so that a partnership makes sense for us. With video channels, for example, we pay particular attention to the number of video views in the last few months, with forums to the number of members and whether contributions are made regularly.

As a rule of thumb, your reach should be in the four-figure range in order to be accepted as a partner.
