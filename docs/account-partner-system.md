## Introduction

Do you have a YouTube channel, stream on Twitch or run an awesome project? Awesome, you may be interested in becoming a ZAP-Hosting partner. Our partners advertise ZAP-Hosting on their platforms in return for great items such as **free servers**, **money** and more. We could even provide a server for a giveaway or raffle on occasions.

## Audience

Our partner program is in particularly (but not limited) aimed at:
- Content Creators
- Gaming/eSports Clans
- Gaming Communities
- Blogs and Forums
- Game Developers

One key determining factor is that your platform of choice has a certain minimum reach and that your target group has potential interest in gameservers and hosting.

As an example, if you are a content creator on YouTube creating Minecraft videos with an acceptable size in audience, you would be a perfect fit for our partner program. On the other hand, a channel such as for makeup tips is not an ideal fit for our affiliate program as the target audience does not fit with our business sector.

## Required reach

As an affiliate, you are required to have a certain amount of reach in order to make a partnership make sense for us. We pay attention to a range of statistics and numbers to determine which applications are ideal as partners.

As an example, as a content creator we would pay particular attention to the number of video views that you have sustained over the past few months, where as in a forms or blog we would look for the number of members and contributions that are present regularly on your site.

As a general rule of thumb, we expect your reach to be around the four-figure (1,000+) range in order to be considered and accepted as a new partner.
