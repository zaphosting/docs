## Introduction
The assignment of administrator permissions allows you simple and comprehensive administration with full control of your server. As an administrator, you have the option of using all available options and functions provided by the game directly in the game. All the steps you need to take to assign administrator permissions for your server will be described below.

## Configuration

The configuration of the admin permissions can be done via your **game server’s settings page**. To do this, open the settings and navigate to the **Admin List** option. Enter your **SteamID64** there to assign yourself as an admin.  If you want to add more players as admins, separate each SteamID with a **comma**.
