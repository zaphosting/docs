## Introduction

In order to manage and configure your Teamspeak server, you need administrator permissions. In the following we will explain how you can add users as admin.

## Preparation

For authentication as admin you need the privilege key. You can find it in the web interface at the Teamspeak Server Administration under **Privilege Keys**. There you have to create a new privilege key if there is none present yet and copy the key after that.

## Assigning permission

Now a connection to the Teamspeak server must be established via the Teamspeak client. If the Teamspeak server hasn't been configured/used yet, then the following popup window will show up when connecting:

There you can fill in the privilege key and confirm the process with the **OK** button. If this window no longer appears, then you can press in the Teamspeak client in the **navigation bar** on **permissions** and then on **use privilege key**. A popup window will then open where you can fill in the privilege key. 


After pressing **OK** your user account will be assigned with the administrator permissions.

## Adding more Admins

If you want to assign administrator permissions to additional users, then you can either create more privilege keys for the corresponding users or assign the corresponding server group in the Teamspeak client itself for the respective user. To do this, right-click on the user, click on Server Groups and then select the server group. 


## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have successfully configured the administrator permissions. For further questions or assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our support team, which is available daily to assist you! 🙂
