## Preparation - The Download

In order for you to join your server, we need a file that enables the connection.
First open [Impostor](https://impostor.github.io/Impostor/) where we need to enter our information.

To create the file, we need information such as the IP, port and a name.

Enter the data from your ZAP-Hosting interface here, it looks like this for example:

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/7scfddD5WPFr25b/preview)

Where 31.214.245.215 is your IP and 2000 is the port.

The server name can be chosen freely, when all data has been entered click on "Download Server File".
A file with the name "regioninfo.json" will now be downloaded.

Next press `Win` + `R` and enter there 

```
%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Innersloth\Among Us
```

and confirm with Enter, a directory will open. Move the regioninfo.json into it and overwrite the existing one.

If you are finished with the settings you can click on "confirm".
You are now connected to your server!

In the lobby you can now set whether it should be a public or a private server.
To change this you can click on the "Private" or "Public" icon:

If the server is set to "Public" other players can connect to the server in the same way.
These players do not have to click on "Create Game" in the main menu of the game but on "Find Game".
Here it is important that the chat is set to "others" and that the filters match the settings of the server exactly.
Otherwise the server will not be displayed.

If it is a "Private" server you have to click on "Enter Code" in the main menu.
Here you enter the code that the creator of the server can see in the lobby.
