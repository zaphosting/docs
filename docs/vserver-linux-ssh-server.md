## Introduction

Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure protocol that enables safe and encrypted access to remote systems. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted across networks.

In this guide, you will understand how to install or reinstall the SSH Server for a range of Linux Distributions that we currently offer across our VPS servers. Most Linux Distros offered through our VPS servers, are equipped with an SSH Server by default which means you can easily manage it through the product's webinterface. You can view how to do this via our guide: [Initial Access with SSH](vserver-linux-ssh.md)

If you wish to learn more about improving your security on your server, we highly recommend viewing our [Linux Security Tips](vserver-linux-security-tips.md) guide which promotes a range of tools and services that can help secure your server further.


## Installation

To start the installation process, access your server via VNC. You can follow these steps using the [VNC Console](vserver-vnc.md).

:::info
If you want to re-install the SSH server, make sure that you uninstall it first. You can do so through the command: `yum remove openssh`.
:::

Before installing the SSH server, make sure your system is up to date. Run the following command:
```
yum update
```

Now proceed to install the SSH server using following command:
```
yum install openssh-server
```

Once it has finished installing, you can start the SSH server service with the following command:
```
systemctl start sshd
```

Ensure that you enable the service to automatically start on system boot. You can do this through the following command:
```
systemctl enable sshd
```

## Enabling root login

To enable root login, you need to edit the openssh configuration file. In this guide, we will use "nano" as editor.

:::info
If "nano" is not already installed, it must be installed first. To do so, use the following command: `yum install nano`
:::

Proceed to open the configuration file by running:
```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
```

Using arrows keys to navigate, search for the following line:
```
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
```

Change this to the following, which enables remote root login:
```
PermitRootLogin yes
```

Finally, restart the SSH Server in order to apply the new configuration by using the following command:
```
systemctl restart sshd
```

```
dnf update

dnf install openssh-server
