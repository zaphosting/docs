## Introduction

Mods allow you to customize your server even more. The following explains where you can find the most popular server mods and how to set them up.



## Preparation

Through the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/221100/workshop/), you have the option to install mods on your server. The Steam Workshop is ideal for discovering and managing new and exciting mods. Start by browsing the Steam Workshop for mods that catch your interest. If you find a mod you like, it's important to note the associated Workshop ID. You can obtain the ID from the URL. This Workshop ID is necessary for the upcoming installation.



## Installation

Next, you can begin installing the mods. Installation is a breeze with the Steam Workshop option. Access your game server's management and navigate to Steam Workshop. There, you have the option to enter the mods in the designated field. Enter the Workshop IDs you noted earlier and add them there. If you are adding multiple mods, make sure to separate the mods with a comma symbol.
