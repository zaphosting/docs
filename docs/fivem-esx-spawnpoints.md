## Introduction

Looking to change the default spawnpoints or add additional ones? The handling of spawnpoints in the **ESX framework** is defined in `es_extended`. The following will explain how you can customize these. 

<InlineVoucher />

## Configuration

The spawn points are adjusted through the `main.lua` configuration file from the `es_extended`Â (../es_extended/shared/config/). This file can be edited via FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP yet, we recommend having a look at the [FTP access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) guide. 

The default configuration of the spawn points looks as follows: 

```
Config.DefaultSpawns = { -- If you want to have more spawn positions and select them randomly uncomment commented code or add more locations
    { x = 222.2027, y = -864.0162, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0 },
    --{x = 224.9865, y = -865.0871, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0},
    --{x = 227.8436, y = -866.0400, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0},
    --{x = 230.6051, y = -867.1450, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0},
    --{x = 233.5459, y = -868.2626, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0}
}
```

Let's assume you want to add more spawn points, then you would have to add another record to the configuration file: 

```
Config.DefaultSpawns = { -- If you want to have more spawn positions and select them randomly uncomment commented code or add more locations
    { x = 222.2027, y = -864.0162, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0 },
    --{x = 224.9865, y = -865.0871, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0},
    --{x = 227.8436, y = -866.0400, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0},
    --{x = 230.6051, y = -867.1450, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0},
    --{x = 233.5459, y = -868.2626, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0}
    --{x = 766.5239, y = -112.0400, z = 30.2922, heading = 1.0} // NEW SPAWN 
}
```

:::info Determine coordinates
A suitable resource is required to obtain the current coordinates. You will find several to choose from on the Internet and can decide which one suits you best. :)
