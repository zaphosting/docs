## Introduction

Every domain name goes through a series of stages from being available for registration to eventual expiration and deletion. Understanding this life cycle helps you maintain control of your domain avoid service interruptions and ensure your online presence remains consistent.

## Domain life cycle stages


### Available

A domain is in the available state when it is not registered by any owner. During this stage, the domain can be [registered](domain-order.md).

### Active

After successful registration, the domain enters the active stage. While active, the domain functions normally and can be used for websites, email addresses, and other services. The domain remains active as long as it is renewed before the expiration date.

### Expired

If the domain is not renewed before its expiration date, it enters the expired state. In this stage, the domain stops working and connected services such as websites and email may become unavailable. Renewal may still be possible depending on the domain extension.

### Grace period

Many domain extensions include a grace period after expiration. During this time, the domain can usually be renewed. The duration of the grace period depends on the top level domain.

### Redemption period

If the domain is not renewed during the grace period, it may enter the redemption period. In this stage, the domain can still be restored, However, not all domain extensions support a redemption period.

### Pending deletion

When the redemption period ends without renewal, the domain moves into pending deletion. At this point, the domain can no longer be recovered. After deletion is completed, the domain becomes available again for registration by anyone.
