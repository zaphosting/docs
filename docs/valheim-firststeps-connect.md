## Requirements

Additional software is not required for the regular use of a Valheim vanilla server. However, if you have chosen the Valheim Plus or BepInEx variant to use plugins, then you also need to install this extension locally. Please have a look here to find out how to install these extensions locally for your game:

## Potential issues and solutions

The connection to a game server can often be established in one or more ways. Available methods are described and explained in detail below.

#### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files.



#### Connection failed

Valheim Plus/BepInEx: The connection may fail if the necessary extension is not installed on the client or it is running on a different version.
