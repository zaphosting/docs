## Introduction

Hytale’s Early Access release offers a rich world filled with diverse items, crafting paths, tools, weapons, and utilities. For new and veteran players alike, the sheer number of items and their hidden properties can be overwhelming, especially early in play when detailed item data is not provided by the base game yet.  

The game itself does not yet include comprehensive item metadata in tooltips or inventory views, which can make understanding an item’s characteristics, uses, and requirements difficult without external references.

To address this gap, the **Advanced Item Info** mod enhances Hytale by providing **additional contextual information** about in-game items via a searchable interface, giving players direct access to detailed data without guesswork.

- Item identification and unique ID  
- Visual icon and quality tier  
- Level requirements and item level  
- Maximum stack size and durability  
- Whether the item is fuel 
- Whether the item is consumable or has special properties  
- Whether the item functions as a tool, weapon, armor, glider, or utility component  
- Tooltip context for where the item can be crafted or obtained


## Using the mod

To install HyFixes, follow the standard mod installation procedure described in the [Install Mods](hytale-mods) guide. This guide explains where mods must be placed and how they are loaded by the server. Once installed, the user interface can be opened with the following in-game command:

```

```

When the GUI is open, players can type or paste item names to search, click or hover over results, and view the rich metadata provided by the mod.
