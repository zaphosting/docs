## Availability of locations

As briefly mentioned in advance, we are continuously developing and expanding the scope of our products. However, this is not necessarily always easy and uncomplicated to implement. For that reason, it can happen that we are not able to offer every product at every location from the beginning. You will find an overview of the availability of the server products at the respective locations below.

## Connection quality to the locations

You are unsure which location is the best for you? That's no problem! We have developed a ping check for our server products, which allows you to test the connection from you to the locations. This way you will get an overview of all ping results at a glance and you can choose the best location for you. 

You will find the ping check option during the order process at the location selection. Click there on the **Ping-Check 🚀** button. The result of the respective location will then be displayed to you.
