## Introduction

Our mission is to provide the best possible availability and accessibility of our server products worldwide. Since our founding in 2010, we have continuously expanded and refined our services to deliver the optimal server experience to customers everywhere no matter where they are located.  

Through steady growth and close collaboration with our community, we have built a truly global network. We consistently take customer feedback into account, regularly assess demand for new regions, and tailor our offerings to ensure top performance and quality.  

For us, this means state-of-the-art infrastructure, reliable connectivity, and rapid response times combined with the clear goal of delivering a stable, powerful, and compelling hosting experience to users around the globe.



## Availability of locations

We are constantly working on developing and expanding our product range to provide you with the best possible server experience. Sometimes, however, it is not possible to make every product available at every location right from the start. To give you clarity, you will find an overview below showing which products are currently available at each location.  

Not sure which location suits you best? No worries! With our integrated ping check, you can easily test the connection from your location to our data centers. At a glance, you’ll receive all results and can then choose the server location that guarantees you the best possible performance.

## More details about each location

Each of our locations is characterized by its specific infrastructure and setup. For every site, you will find detailed information about the data center, the hardware in use, and the DDoS protection measures implemented. This gives you a clear overview of the technical foundation, security standards, and performance capabilities provided at each location.

#### Europe

<details>
  <summary>FFM / Eygelshoven, DE</summary>

Brief description of the location, partner data center, and regional advantages (e.g., proximity to DE-CIX, London, NY-IX). Mention certifications (ISO 27001, Tier-level) or specific location benefits (low latency, reliable power supply). 

**Hardware & Infrastructure**

Our infrastructure is based on modern, high-performance hardware designed to deliver maximum stability, efficiency, and responsiveness across all product lines. Each product is powered by the processor architecture best suited to its purpose. 

Game servers in the standard edition run on AMD EPYC 7000 Series processors optimized for high concurrency, while the premium edition uses AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPUs with high clock speeds for exceptional single-core performance. 

Virtual private servers (VPS) also rely on AMD EPYC 7000 Series processors, offering robust multi-core capabilities ideal for virtualized environments.

All systems are equipped exclusively with NVMe SSD storage for ultra-fast read and write speeds, ensuring minimal latency and maximum responsiveness. Combined with redundant networking and optimized configurations, this hardware foundation guarantees a smooth and reliable hosting experience for every use case.




**Network & Latency**

The data center is connected through multiple redundant fiber links to international carriers and backbone providers. This ensures extremely high transmission capacity, ranging from Gbit/s up to Tbit/s, providing stable connectivity even during peak traffic periods.  

With direct peering agreements and connections to major internet exchanges such as DE-CIX, LINX, or AMS-IX, the data center achieves the shortest possible routes across the global network. As a result, it delivers very low latency to key regions and ensures fast, reliable connectivity for all applications.

**Power Supply & Redundancy**

Details on power infrastructure (multiple feeds, UPS systems, diesel generators), cooling (N+1 or higher redundancy, free cooling), and energy efficiency or sustainability (e.g., 100% renewable energy).  

**DDoS Protection**

The DDoS protection in place at this location is powered by **Name of the Protection**. It ensures that attacks are automatically detected and mitigated in real time. With high mitigation capacities – depending on the infrastructure, ranging from several hundred Gbit/s up to multiple Tbit/s – even large-scale attacks are reliably neutralized. 

Advanced filtering and analysis technologies are in place to block both simple and sophisticated attack types effectively. For our customers, this results in consistent availability, stable performance, and uninterrupted operations even during ongoing attacks. Learn more about how we keep your services safe in our detailed [DDoS Protection](ddos-protection.md) document!


**Support & Monitoring**

Our entire infrastructure is monitored 24/7 by an automated system that immediately detects any disruptions or irregularities. In such cases, our technicians are instantly notified and can intervene. Our support team is available every day from early morning until late at night, ensuring that customer requests are handled quickly and reliably.

  <summary>London, UK</summary>

With our location in **London** (UK) in the **OVH** data center, we are expanding our coverage in Europe. In addition to our main location "Frankfurt am Main", customers from **UK** specifically benefit from our location in London. Other European countries on the mainland already have excellent latency to Frankfurt, so there is no need here to offer additional locations on the mainland.

**Hardware**

Rented Intel server processors and Intel OC gaming CPUs with high clock rates are used. Only NVMe SSD hard disks are used.

**DDoS Protection**

The DDoS Protection in the data center is very strong and withstands even heavy attacks without losses.

**On-site personnel**

Our technicians are available around the clock in case of problems and will be informed fully automatically by our monitoring system whenever intervention is necessary. This allows immediate intervention of a technician on site.
