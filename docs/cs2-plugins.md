## Introduction

Since the development of Counter-Strike, the game has evolved from a simple Half-Life mod to one of the most well-known and long-lived first-person shooters in the world. But what makes Counter-Strike especially unique and versatile are not only the official game modes, but also the countless custom modes created and made possible by the worldwide community through plugins.

## Current situation

With CS2 and the associated move to the Source2 engine, a lot has happened and changed. New changes can bring a lot of positive as well as negative. One disadvantage of the switch is currently the situation with plugins in CS2. At this point, there are little to no public projects for plugin development. 

The previous development project for the CS:GO game, which is based on [Metamod](https://www.sourcemm.net/) and [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/), is not really designed for use with CS2. Metamod works at least to some extent. At the current time, it is still uncertain if and when there will be further development for the CS2 game. 

The information about this is currently very limited and unclear. The current situation can be followed here:

However, apart from Sourcemod/Metamod, other projects are also being developed at the moment. One of these projects is [ResourceMod](https://resourcemod.net/) for example, which was recently presented on Reddit. However, the project is still under development and cannot be used at the moment.
