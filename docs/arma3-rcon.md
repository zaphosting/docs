## Introduction

RCON (Remote Console) is a network protocol used to remotely control gameservers. It allows access to the server console without direct interaction with the server environment. This makes it possible to execute administrative commands, adjust configuration parameters, or retrieve server status information.

In Arma 3, RCON is used to execute server-side commands, such as managing players, changing gameplay settings, or accessing diagnostic outputs. The connection is protected by a password and operates over a specified port, accessible via compatible RCON clients.

A key advantage of RCON is that it enables server management **without having to be connected to the game as a player**. Server administrators can monitor and control Arma 3 from external tools, command-line interfaces, or web dashboards, offering flexibility and convenience for remote operation.

## Configuration

Before RCON can be used, it must be enabled and configured. This can be done directly in the gameserver administration. Under the **Settings** section, there is an option called **RCON** that must be activated. A secure password should be set.

The assigned RCON port can be found at the bottom of the settings page in the **Port overview**. 



## Connecting via RCON

To connect to the Arma 3 server via RCON, the tool **BattleWarden** is used. It is available for download from the [official website](https://www.battlewarden.net). After downloading and installing the tool on your computer, a new connection profile must be created. The following values are required:

- Server IP address  
- RCON port 
- RCON password

Once the connection is established, RCON commands can be executed through the graphical interface. The tool also offers additional features such as player lists, live chat, and command history, depending on the gameâ€™s integration.

## RCON Commands

Once connected via RCON, various administrative and diagnostic commands can be executed on the Arma 3 server. The available commands depend on the game engine but typically include actions for player management, status queries, and server control.
