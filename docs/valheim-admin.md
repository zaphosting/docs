## Introduction
The assignment of administrator permissions allows you simple and comprehensive administration with full control of your server. As an administrator, you have the option of using all available options and functions provided by the game directly in the game. All the steps you need to take to assign administrator permissions for your server will be described below.

### Configuration
To Add yourself as Admin, you first need to get your SteamID64, you can use a tool like the [Steam ID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/)

Here you enter your Steam URL:

Then press `Find Steam ID`

Now we should be able to see our Steam Profile, here we copy our "Steam64ID (Dec)".

Now we open our Servers Webinterface and open the Settings Page, here we will see an "Admins" Option where we can add our Steam ID:

After we have added our Steam ID, we save the Settings and then Restart the Server.
