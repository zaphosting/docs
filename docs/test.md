## Preparation

The first thing you need to do is to download the mods that you want to install on your server. You can find a large selection of mods at [7daystodiemods.com](https://7daystodiemods.com/). There you will find more than 1000 mods and more are added regularly. If you have downloaded a mod, then it should contain the following file structure:

```
  Config/
  ItemIcons/
  Resources/
  ModInfo.xml
```



## Installation

Once the desired mods have been downloaded, you can start with the actual installation of the mods. The setup of the mods is done via FTP. You need a FTP client to be able to upload files to your server. If you don't know what FTP is and how it works, then you should have a look at the following guide: [Access via FTP](gameserver-ftpaccess.md)

Under the ``/gXXXXX4/7dtd-linux-exp/`` directory you have to create a folder named **Mods**. To do this, right-click and click on **Create directory**.

Afterwards the files of the mod have to be uploaded to the mods directory:

This already completes the installation of the mod. The next time you start the server, the mods should then be loaded automatically.
