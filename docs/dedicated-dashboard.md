### Edit rDNS

Adjust the reverse DNS entry (PTR record) for your server’s IP address to point to the correct hostname. A properly configured rDNS helps ensure that your server’s Dedicated Server name resolves correctly and is especially important for running a mail server. Without a valid rDNS, outgoing emails may be marked as spam or fail to deliver reliably.
