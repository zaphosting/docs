## What is a domain?

A domain can represent your name or your project on the Internet and make it accessible worldwide. You can use a domain for example to make a website reachable online, furthermore you can forward a domain to a game or TeamSpeak 3 server and reach it online with an easy memorable name.



## Subdomains

A **subdomain** is a child domain which you can create at any time for free for your existing domain. This is done via the DNS settings, a subdomain can look like this for example: **server.fivem-server.com**.

In this case **server** is your subdomain and **fivem-server.de** is the name of the actual domain. A subdomain usually redirects to a different address compared to the actual domain, so you can for example make your website accessible with **fivem-server.com** while you can connect to your FiveM or another game server with **server.fivem-server.com**.




## Domains and IP addresses

Unlike an IP address, you have to rent a domain individually, this is **NOT** automatically included with a game server, root server, VPS or voice server. A domain already differs in appearance from an IP address. While an IP address consists of numbers, for example **140.82.118.3**, a domain has a real name and a corresponding domain extension, for example fivem.net. So **fivem** would be the name of the domain and **.net** the domain extension. Besides **.net** there are of course many other domain extensions like **.com** or **.de**.
