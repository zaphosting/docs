## Requirements

Additional software may be required to connect to the game server for this game. For the vanilla version of Minecraft, i.e. without additional mods or modpacks, no additional software is required. If you want to use mods/modpacks, you will also need the matching launcher. You can see which launcher you need for the respective mod or modpack by the name of the game in the dashboard.

#### Mods
If you want to use mods, you will also need the matching mod loader. Depending on whether you want to use mods from Forge or Fabric, you will require one of the two. 

- [Minecraft: Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) - To use Forge mods, it is necessary to download and install Forge.
- [Minecraft: Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) - To use Fabric mods, it is necessary to download and install Fabric.

Forge and also Fabric Mods must be installed manually both in the game and in the server software so that a connection can be established.

:::danger Don't mix Fabric/Forge mods
Fabric and Forge are not compatible with each other. Forge mods must run on Forge, and Fabric mods must run on Fabric. Mixing can lead to both client and server crashes. 
:::


#### Modpacks
If you want to use one of the modpacks, you will also need the matching launcher. You can see which launcher you need for the respective modpack by the name of the game in the dashboard. 
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) - To use modpacks from the Curse / Twitch Launcher, it is necessary to download it and install the modpack from there. 
- [Feed The Beast](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) - To use modpacks from the Feed The Beast Launcher, it is necessary to download it and install the modpack from there. 
- [Technic Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/) - To use modpacks from the Technic Launcher, it is necessary to download it and install the modpack from there.

## Potential issues and solutions

The establishment of the connection does not work as expected? This may happen in certain situations, when the connection fails due to technical issues. We have listed the most common issues and their solutions below:

#### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully for some reason. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files.

#### Connection failed, Connection timed out.
This error message means that a connection with the server could not be established within the scheduled time frame. The causes for this can be various. More information can usually be found in the logs or live console.

#### Mismatched mod channel list
This error message occurs when there is a difference in mods between the client and the server. This can for example occur if individual mods are missing or they are installed for a different version. In this case, the mods should preferably be reinstalled and checked on the client and the server.
