## Types of wipes

There are three variants for the server wipe option. These are the **partial**, **gold** and **full wipe**, which are explained in more detail below::

- **Partial wipe:** This type of wipe partially deletes the contents of the save files, removing builds, custom map zones, but leaving player progress intact.
- **Gold wipe:** This type of wipe partially deletes the contents of the save files, removing builds, custom map zones, but leaving player progress intact.
- **Full wipe:** This type of wipe completely deletes the contents of the save files, removing builds, custom map zones and player progress.



## Perform a wipe

The server settings in the game allow you to call up the possible wipe options. To do this, connect to your server and open the **Server Settings** menu.
