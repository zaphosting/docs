## Introduction

Looking to change the default spawnpoints or add additional ones? The handling of spawnpoints in the **QBCore framework** is defined via the `qb-spawn` resource. The following will explain how you can customize these. 

<InlineVoucher />

## Configuration

The spawn points are adjusted through the `config.lua` configuration file from the `qb-spawn` resource. This file can be edited via FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP yet, we recommend having a look at the [FTP access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) guide. 

The default configuration of the spawn points looks as follows: 

```
QB.Spawns = {
    ["legion"] = { -- Index for the table
        coords = vector4(195.17, -933.77, 29.7, 144.5), -- Where player spawns
        location = "legion", -- this is how the javascript knows which you picked
        label = "Legion Square", -- What the player sees in the menu
    },

    ["policedp"] = {
        coords = vector4(428.23, -984.28, 29.76, 3.5),
        location = "policedp",
        label = "Police Department",
    },

    ["paleto"] = {
        coords = vector4(80.35, 6424.12, 31.67, 45.5),
        location = "paleto",
        label = "Paleto Bay",
    },

    ["motel"] = {
        coords = vector4(327.56, -205.08, 53.08, 163.5),
        location = "motel",
        label = "Motels",
    },
```

Let's assume you want to add more spawn points, then you would have to add another record to the configuration file: 

```
["new_spawn_name"] = { -- Needs to be unique
    coords = vector4(1.1, -1.1, 1.1, 180.0), -- Coords player will be spawned
    location = "new_spawn_name", -- Needs to be unique
    label = "New spawn name", -- This is the label which will show up in selection menu.
},
```

:::info Determine coordinates
A suitable resource is required to obtain the current coordinates. You will find several to choose from on the Internet and can decide which one suits you best. :)

The end result would then be as follows: 

```
    QB.Spawns = {
    
        ["legion"] = { -- Index for the table
            coords = vector4(195.17, -933.77, 29.7, 144.5), -- Where player spawns
            location = "legion", -- this is how the javascript knows which you picked
            label = "Legion Square", -- What the player sees in the menu
        },
    
        ["policedp"] = {
            coords = vector4(428.23, -984.28, 29.76, 3.5),
            location = "policedp",
            label = "Police Department",
        },
    
        ["paleto"] = {
            coords = vector4(80.35, 6424.12, 31.67, 45.5),
            location = "paleto",
            label = "Paleto Bay",
        },
    
        ["motel"] = {
            coords = vector4(327.56, -205.08, 53.08, 163.5),
            location = "motel",
            label = "Motels",
        },
        
        ["new_spawn_name"] = { -- Needs to be unique
        coords = vector4(1.1, -1.1, 1.1, 180.0), -- Coords player will be spawned
        location = "new_spawn_name", -- Needs to be unique
        label = "New spawn name", -- This is the label which will show up in selection menu.
         },
    }
```
