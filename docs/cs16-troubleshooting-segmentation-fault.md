## Cause

The cause for this error message can be varied. The most common causes include the following:

<details>
  <summary>Faulty configuration</summary>

An improperly or incompletely configured configuration file can result in the server accessing invalid parameters or invalid memory areas at startup or during operation.

This can occur in particular if, for example, indentations or value assignments are not applied correctly. As a result, this can lead to a crash or undefined behavior (e.g. segmentation fault).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Invalid or corrupted server files</summary>

  Due to faulty transfers, manual changes or damaged installations, it is possible for central server files to become corrupted. This can lead to unexpected behavior or critical crashes such as a segmentation fault when loading or executing.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Incomplete updates or missing dependencies</summary>

  If a server update is not fully completed or certain dependencies or modules are missing, errors may occur at startup or during runtime.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Incompatible or faulty server plugins</summary>

  Additional extensions such as SourceMod/Metamod or plugins that aren't compatible with the server version used or are programmed incorrectly can have a direct impact on the server's memory access and cause issues accordingly. 

</details>



## Solution

In order to resolve the issue that may arise due to one of the previously mentioned causes, you can follow the following solutions: 

<details>
  <summary>Validation of the server files</summary>

To avoid possible errors due to damaged or incomplete game files, it is recommended to perform the **Validate Steam Files** feature in the game server **Dashboard**.

  The game server is automatically checked via the SteamCMD and missing or faulty files will be replaced with the original version. The process is fully automated and ensures that the server files match the current Steam version.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Deactivation/removal of additional content</summary>

If you have added additional content such as Sourcemod/Metamod and plugins to your game server, it makes sense to temporarily deactivate and remove them at least once.

This step can rule out whether the issues are caused by the additional content. After updates, for example, there can often be issues with such additional content because it is no longer or not yet compatible with the new server version.
