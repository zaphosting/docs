Sadly Valheim is not offering a direct way to do automated Backups, so we need to use a little workaround. 

Navigate in your dashboard to "Restart Planner".

Now click on the "+" it opens a new window, in which we can define the desired Restart times.

First we choose if desired "Daily", which means that on every day a backup will be created on the time we choose.
In the next step we define our desired restart time.

Start offline server - Means that your server will be started if its offline, when the reinstallation time is met.

Now we click on "Save".

:::info
You could setup a planned restart all 6 hours, what means that all 6 hours a automated backup will be created.
