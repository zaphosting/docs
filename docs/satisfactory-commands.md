Satisfactory has a wide range of useful commands available for players to adjust client settings. Within this page we summarise the popular and useful commands that are commonly used by players across Satisfactory.

## Accessing the console
Using the console within Satisfactory is very easy, simply press the ` key (backtick is located above TAB key) to cycle between console visibility. The console will either become closed, will be open with a small command window at the bottom or will be fully expanded each time you toggle.

:::info
If the backtick key doesn't work for you, follow the steps in the sub-section below to set and enable a new keybind.
:::

### Unable to access the console
Sometimes due to regional keyboards the default backtick activation console key may not work, thus you need to setup a new one. Before doing this, close Satisfactory if it's running.

Press `Windows-Key + R` or search in your startmenu for `Run`. Next, copy the following path into it:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
:::

Open up the `Input.ini` file with a text editor (such as notepad).

Next copy and paste the exact lines to the bottom:

`[/script/engine.inputsettings] ConsoleKey=F6`

Finally, save and restart your game and now you will be able to open the console with `F6` as a keybind.

## Console Commands

The table consist of the command itself, the accepted values for the command (if applicable) and a description to make it easier to understand.

In order to display the entire list of commands, use `?` in the console which will display a hovering list of all the different commands. You can navigate this hovering list by simply using the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys.

An example of using the `?` to view all commands can be viewed below.
