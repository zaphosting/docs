## Introduction

Are you unsure about what version of Minecraft you should install or buy a server for? Don't worry! This guide will tell you everything about Java and Bedrock Edition (referred to as *Java* and *Bedrock* throughout this page) so you can make an educated choice.

## Basics

Here is a table which explains some basic information about both Minecraft versions.

| Edition:                       | *Java*                        | *Bedrock*                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Launch date:                   | 2009                          | September 2017            |
| Made with:                     | Java                          | Bedrock Engine            |
| Based on:                      | Minecraft - the original game | Minecraft: Pocket Edition |
| Latest version (as of writing) | 1.20.2                        | 1.20.32                   |

## Platforms

The most important question people ask when starting to play Minecraft is: "On which device can I play?". Minecraft *Java* edition, the original game, can only be played on Windows, macOS, and Linux and has higher system prerequisites (especially if you start adding [shaders and other mods](#customization-and-modding)), while Minecraft *Bedrock* edition can be played on almost all devices, from phones to computers and consoles, with full cross-platform capabilities.

## Updates

Both versions receive consistent updates, but for testing versions, the term "snapshot" is used on *Java* and "beta" on *Bedrock* (only on Windows, Xbox and Android). Worlds are usually accessible between different game versions on both Minecraft editions, however certain major updates (such as 1.18 to 1.19) could potentially bring direct changes to world generation which impacts seeds, meaning your older world could not experience newer updated items. For such instances, it would make sense to begin a new world. For vanilla worlds, all clients connecting to a server must have the same version of Minecraft in order to be able to connect.

:::caution 
Be careful whilst using the snapshot/beta versions of the respective game, as your world could become corrupt. It is always recommended to back up your worlds regularly!

## Multiplayer

Do you want to have a 24/7 open world you and others can play on? Both Minecraft versions support hosting so-called "game servers" for you to enjoy, though they have different menus and options to go through. Please refer to [this guide for connecting](minecraft-firststeps-connect) if you have issues regarding this. Don't have a server yet? ZAP-Hosting has got you covered with [high-quality Minecraft servers ready in 60 seconds](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/cloud-gameserver/minecraft)! We offer game servers for both Minecraft versions.

## Customization and Modding

When booting up the game for the first time, a common trend is for players to edit their skins. These can be custom-made with online tools or bought from the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) (*Minecraft Bedrock Edition's* in-game store) using Minecoins (a virtual currency you can buy). For *Java*, you can find a range of free sites with skins or design your own, and upload it to your *Java* edition account via the **Minecraft Launcher**, through the `Skins` tab or use one of the default ones found in this area.

*Java* is more open to modders and has a couple of different "launchers" (for example, [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) & [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)) allowing for some interesting new content and mods to be added and maintained by the community. For further insights about the vast field of *Java* edition modding, take a look at our [installing mods and modpack](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/docs/minecraft-forge-fabric-add-mods-modpacks) guide, which covers this well.

*Bedrock* provides a way for easier installation of custom maps, texture packs and game modes via their [store](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/catalog) directly.
