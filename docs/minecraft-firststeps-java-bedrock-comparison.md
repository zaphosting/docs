## Introduction
Are you unsure about what version of Minecraft you should install or buy a server for? Don't worry! This guide will tell you everything about Java and Bedrock Edition (referred to as *Java* and *Bedrock* throughout this page) so you can make an educated choice. If you want to skip to a certain chapter, you can do so using the table of contents.

## Basics 

| Edition: | *Java* | *Bedrock* |
| - | - | - |
| Launch date: | 2009 | September 2017 |
| Made with: | Java | Bedrock Engine |
| Based on: | Minecraft - the original game | Minecraft: Pocket Edition |
| Latest version (as of writing this) | 1.20.2 | 1.20.32 |

## Platforms
The most important question people ask when starting to play Minecraft is: "On which device can I play?". *Java*, the original game, can only be played on Windows, macOS, and Linux and has higher system requirements (especially if you start adding [shaders and other mods](#customization-and-modding)), while *Bedrock* can be played on almost all devices, from phones to computers and consoles, with full cross-platform capabilities.

## Updates

Both versions get consistent updates, but for testing versions, the term "snapshot" is used on *Java* and "beta" on *Bedrock* (only on Windows, Xbox and Android).

:::caution Please be careful while loading these, as your world could become corrupt. It is always recommended to back up your worlds regularly!

## Multiplayer
Do you want to have a 24/7 open world you and others can play on? All Minecraft versions support hosting so-called "game servers" for you to enjoy, though they have different menus and options to go through. Please refer to [this guide for connecting](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/docs/minecraft-firststeps-connect) if you have issues regarding this. Don't you have a server yet? Zap-Hosting has got you covered with their quality servers ([click here for more info](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/cloud-gameserver/minecraft/)).

## Customization and Modding
When booting up the game for the first time, a common trend is for players to edit their skins. These can be custom-made with online tools or bought from the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) (*Bedrock's* in-game store) using Minecoins (a virtual currency you can buy).

*Java* is more open to modders and has a couple of different "launchers" (for example, [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) & [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)) allowing for some interesting new content to be added and maintained by the community. *Bedrock* provides a way for easier installation of custom maps, texture packs and game modes via their [store](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/catalog).

## Conclusion
We hope this guide helped you gain more knowledge about this wonderful game and decide which version you'll begin exploring the vast open world on. If you're still debating which one to choose: both versions are always available for download. ;) Try them both and tell us your opinion on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zaphosting).
