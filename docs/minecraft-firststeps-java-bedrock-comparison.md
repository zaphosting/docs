## Introduction
Are you unsure about what version of Minecraft you should install or buy a server for? Don't worry! This guide will tell you everything about Java and Bedrock Edition (referred to as *Java* and *Bedrock* throughout this page) so you can make an educated choice. If you want to skip to a certain chapter, you can do so using the table of contents.

## Basics 
| Edition: | *Java* | *Bedrock* |
| - | - | - |
| Launch date: | 2009 | September 2017 |
| Made with: | Java | Bedrock Engine |
| Based on: | Minecraft - the original game | Minecraft: Pocket Edition |
| Latest version (as of writing) | 1.20.2 | 1.20.32 |

## Platforms
The most important question people ask when starting to play Minecraft is: "On which device can I play?". Minecraft *Java* edition, the original game, can only be played on Windows, macOS, and Linux and has higher system requirements (especially if you start adding [shaders and other mods](#customization-and-modding)), while Minecraft *Bedrock* edition can be played on almost all devices, from phones to computers and consoles, with full cross-platform capabilities.

## Updates
Both versions receive consistent updates, but for testing versions, the term "snapshot" is used on *Java* and "beta" on *Bedrock* (only on Windows, Xbox and Android).

:::caution 
Be careful whilst using the snapshot/beta versions of the respective game, as your world could become corrupt. It is always recommended to back up your worlds regularly!

## Multiplayer
Do you want to have a 24/7 open world you and others can play on? Both Minecraft versions support hosting so-called "gameservers" for you to enjoy, though they have different menus and options to go through. Please refer to [this guide for connecting](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/docs/minecraft-firststeps-connect) if you have issues regarding this. Don't have a server yet? ZAP-Hosting has got you covered with [high-quality Minecraft servers ready in 60 seconds](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/cloud-gameserver/minecraft/)! We offer gameservers for both Minecraft versions.

## Customization and Modding
When booting up the game for the first time, a common trend is for players to edit their skins. These can be custom-made with online tools or bought from the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) (*Minecraft Bedrock Edition's* in-game store) using Minecoins (a virtual currency you can buy).

*Java* is more open to modders and has a couple of different "launchers" (for example, [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) & [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)) allowing for some interesting new content and mods to be added and maintained by the community. *Bedrock* provides a way for easier installation of custom maps, texture packs and game modes via their [store](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/catalog) directly.
