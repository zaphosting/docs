## Introduction
Assigning admin permissions on a Hytale server allows trusted players to help manage the server. Admins, also referred to as operators, can execute server commands, manage players, and assist with server moderation.  This makes delegation of routine tasks easier for server owners and helps maintain a smooth gameplay experience.

## Assigning permissions



Admins on a Hytale server are granted operator status, which gives them elevated command permissions. This can be done either through the **server console** or **in-game commands** by an existing operator. To grant operator permissions to a player, enter the following in the server console or in-game with sufficient permissions:

```
/op add <playername>
```



## Removing permissions

If a player no longer requires admin access or should no longer have elevated permissions, their operator status can be removed at any time:

```
/op remove <playername>
```

Once removed, the player will return to standard permission levels and will no longer be able to use admin commands.



## Conclusion

Becoming an admin on a Hytale server via operator permissions is a core part of server management, enabling trusted players to assist with moderation and administrative tasks.
