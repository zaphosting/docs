Add "/wp-admin" at the end of your website's url (e.g., "www.yourwebsite.com/wp-admin") and press Enter. This will redirect you to the WordPress admin login page, where you have to log in using your old hosting WordPress admin panel credentials.

**Update your Domain's DNS settings**

Now, you have to configure the Domain DNS settings by replacing your old hosting's webspace's IP address to ZAP Hosting's webspace IP address. Start by logging into your Domain hosting account and navigating to your Domain's DNS settings tab. You have to replace the existing 'A' record, which is currently pointing to the old hosting provider's webspace IP address. Replace the old webspace IP address with the new webspace IP address provided by ZAP Hosting, ensuring to change every 'A' records if there are multiple 'A' records pointing to the same old WordPress hosting webspace IP address. Once completed, your Domain will be ready to render your WordPress website from ZAP Hosting.
