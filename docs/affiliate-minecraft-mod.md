## Introduction

As part of our goal to empower our affiliates and partners within the realm of Minecraft Modpacks, we offer an **Official ZAP-Hosting Affiliate Mod** for Minecraft which works with Forge, Fabric and NeoForge - the three core mod development platforms.

The mod is primarily published directly through **CurseForge** which can be [accessed here](https://zap-hosting.com/mc-affiliate-mod) and used by anyone.

## Main Purpose

The purpose of this mod is to provide an easy method for modpack creators to integrate their affiliate contributions directly in-game, without the hassle of developing own mods or editing menus to accomplish this. Through this drag-and-drop mod, it makes it easier than ever for our affiliates to earn commissions from their modpacks to directly support them and their community!

## What does the mod do?

Our mod implements client-side affiliate features into the in-game menus which is currently composed of three features. Each of these features will open the player's browser to the creator's configured affiliate link when clicked on.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="multiplayer-screen-banner" label="Multiplayer Screen Banner" default>

This feature adds a **ZAP-Hosting** banner at the top of the server list on the multiplayer screen. It follows the traditional server entry design so it fits perfectly into the menu.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="title-screen-realms-button" label="Title Screen Realms Button">

This feature replaces the default **Realms** button on the title screen with a **ZAP-Hosting** button. When the button is hovered upon, it displays the creator's configured affilite discount code.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="title-screen-banner" label="Title Screen Banner">

This feature adds a small banner on the title screen. The location and size can be adjusted by the creator so that it can be places exactly where needed.

</Tabs>

All of these features can be toggled individually, with various configuration options available ensuring that the final implementation is always up to the creator!

:::note Note for Players
Please keep in mind that the main use for this mod is for our affiliates to bundle it with their modpacks to allow them to easily earn commissions and gain support from players. Therefore, if you stumble upon this mod in a modpack, consider this the choice of the mod creator and not spam. As a player, you are more than welcome to remove the mod manually from a modpack if you wish, since this mod doesn't influence functionality at all and only adjusts client-side menus.
