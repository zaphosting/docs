## Introduction

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. To ensure uninterrupted service for our customers, ZAP-Hosting uses proven DDoS protection solutions, tailored to the data center location.

Our DDoS protection systems operate automatically and in real-time, filtering malicious traffic before it can affect server performance or availability.

## DDoS Protection Solutions

Different DDoS protection systems are deployed at ZAP-Hosting depending on the geographical location and network infrastructure of the respective data center. Each site is equipped with a mitigation solution that is specifically chosen to provide the best balance of performance, reliability, and responsiveness against attack patterns commonly performed
