## Server

The beta version of the SCP Secret Laboratory Server is offered as a separate game. This means that you have to change the game if you use this version. The option to do this can be found in the game server administration under Games. If you need help with this, we recommend that you also have a look at our [Change the game](gameserver-gameswitch.md) guide.

:::warning Plugin Support
The use of the Exiled extension for plugins is not supported for the beta version. 
:::

:::danger Game change (SCP: EXILED to SCP: BETA)
Changing the game from **SCP: Exiled** to **SCP: Beta** requires a change of host system due to the different conditions. During this process, the existing data will be erased and there will also be a change of IP address if you haven't booked one of your own.
