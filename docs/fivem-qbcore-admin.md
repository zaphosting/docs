## Introduction
The assignment of administrator permissions allows you simple and comprehensive administration with full control of your server. As an administrator, you have the option of using all available options and functions provided by the game directly in the game. All the steps you need to take to assign administrator permissions for your server will be described below.

## Configuration

Thanks to our web interface you can quickly and easily become an admin.
Open the settings of your server:

there look for the option "Admins - Steam64 IDs (e.g. for Nucleus, vMenu, EasyAdmin)".

in the next step you have to find out your STEAM64 ID, open one of the following pages:

- https://steamrep.com/
- https://steamidfinder.com/
- https://steamid.io/

in this example we use steamid.io, log in there via STEAM:
