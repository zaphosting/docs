## Introduction

In Arma 3 there are different ranks which can be assigned to a player. These include Cop, Medic and the different Admin ranks.
Depending on the server, there can be other ranks if for example a new faction or profession is added.
In the following you will learn how to assign the ranks for Cop's, Medic's and Administrators in the game, always using the database within the table **players**.

IMPORTANT: To find the name of the player in the database you have to connect to the server at least once!

There you can now easily select the rank level via the drop-down menu, available are levels from 1 to 7 for cops and from 1 to 5 for medics.
The higher the level, the more permissions the Cop or Medic has in the game, this has among other things an influence on the available weapons and vehicles.

of the server is not necessary.
