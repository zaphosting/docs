## Changing your FiveM Version
Thanks to our gamecloud, you can easily switch between all fivem versions for free.

> ⚠️ The change between the linux based Games (txAdmin, ESX Roleplay, FiveM Linux) to Windows, will erase all data

You should always have a backup of your data, you can easily create one in your "Backup"-tab in the interface.

## The change in detail
To change the game (the version) of your FiveM-Server, you need to open "Games" in our interface.

There you can see all Fivem versions in "Available Games", simply search there "FiveM"

Choose the version of your like and press the green button to start the installation. There will be a popup which requires a confirmation to start the process.

> ⚠️ A change between Linux and Windows, changes the ip address of your server, if you haven't booked your own

> ⚠️ If you switch between ESX RP, Linux or txAdmin you need to enable the version after the installation with the blue button in Games
