## Requirements

First of all, it is necessary to clarify which requirements have to be met so that a connection to the server is possible. This includes, for example, the game, additional content (extensions) such as mods/plugins and the general server information such as IP address, port and server name.



### Game / Contents

For the connection to your game server, it is mandatory that you already own the game. This is not provided by us when renting a server. Additional extensions are not required for the game.



### Server information

Provided that all requirements of **Game / Content** are met, you will need the information of your server. Click on your game server service in your dashboard. The overview will now show you all general information about your server.

The relevant information includes the **IP address,** **Port** and **Password (Optional)**. You should remember these, because you will need them for your first connection to your server.



## Connect to the server

Once all the requirements have been met, you can begin to connect to the server. To do this, start your game. Click on **Custom Server** in the main menu. The server list should now open. There you have the possibility to search for your server. Enter the name of your server in the search field.

## Potential problems and solutions

The establishment of the connection does not work as expected? This may happen in certain situations, when the connection fails due to a technical problem. We have listed the most common problems and their solutions below:



### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully for some reason. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files.
