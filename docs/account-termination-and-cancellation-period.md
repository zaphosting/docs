## Introduction

In this guide, you will be able to learn more about our current policies regarding termination and cancellation of our products. We will also showcase the processes for both terminating or cancelling your product.

## Our Policies

In order to understand the applicable terms to your product, you must know your product's **settlement type**. You can find out which settlement type you selected at the time of purchase by accessing your [web interface dashboard](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/) on our website whilst logged in, and selecting the **Show Package** blue button.

- Termination Period: This refers to the period of time that you have from the purchase date, in order to change your mind and cancel your product. You will be credited with ZAP Coins (account credit) if you choose to terminate, which you can spend on another product.
- Cancellation Period: This refers to the period of time prior to which you must let us know about your decision to cancel your contract. This only applies to **Contract** settlement products.

## Terminating your Product

Regardless of the settlement type for your product, you have a **14 day** period in which you can decide to terminate and revoke your order for any reason. We do not offer a full refund as stated in our general terms and the terms that you accepted during the order process.

However, as a matter of courtesy for our customers we do provide you with the option to revoke your order and receive ZAP Coins (account credit) to your ZAP-Hosting account, which you can spend on another product. There is a small €3 fee that applies which is deducted from the total that is credited to your account.

#### Termination Process

To begin, login to your ZAP-Hosting account and head over to your [web interface dashboard](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/).

From here, head over to the **Orders** section on the left-hand side panel.

On this page, locate the product that you wish to terminate. Once found, select the red **Revoke Order** button.

You will see a prompt appear which provides you with key information as well as your eligibility for termination. Select **Continue Revocation** if you wish to proceed with the process.

Lastly the prompt will extend to present you with information regarding the refund in ZAP Coins that you will receive. We are sad to see you terminate your order and we hope that you can provide us with some feedback for improvement. Once certain, select **Revoke Order** to complete the process.

You have now completed the termination process. It may take a few minutes for the process to complete, please be patient.

## Cancelling your Product

:::info
Cancellations only apply to the **Contract** settlement type. Prepaid servers are paid upfront with no commitment therefore no cancellation period is needed.
:::

By selecting the contract settlement type, you agreed to a recurring subscription for the product based on the selected billing interval.

The current **cancellation period** is **7 days** for all of our products, with the exception of Root Servers and Dedicated Servers which have a cancellation period of **28 days**.

What this means for you, is that you must submit a cancellation request in due time before renewal based upon your selected billing interval, or the contract will become extended for another billing period.

Here is a useful example to help with understanding:

- You are renting a Game Server contract with a regular 1 month (30 days) billing period.
- Scenario 1: You currently have <u>12 days</u> left until your next billing cycle. This means that you can safely submit a cancellation request, and you contract will end after the 12 day period.
- Scenario 2: You currently have <u>3 days</u> left until your next billing cycle. Unfortuantely, you didn't provide the 7 days notice that is required for cancellation, therefore your contract will be <u>renewed</u> for another billing interval and payment, before being subsequently ended after the following time expires.

#### Cancellation Process

To begin, login to your ZAP-Hosting account and head over to your [web interface dashboard](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/).

On the dashboard, locate your **contract** product and select the blue **Show Package** button.

Now on this page, select the red **Cancel Contract** option in the top right corner.

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/cTwq7FD6pZzRyBb/preview)

This will open up a prompt, which presents you with the option to contact our Support Team or continue with cancellation. If you wish to proceed, continue with the **Cancel Contract** option.

Lastly, you will be able to view information regarding the cancellation. As per our policies, you will be able to view the next possible cancellation date. We are sad to see you cancel your product and we hope that you can provide us with some feedback for improvement. Once certain, select **Cance Contract** to complete the process.
