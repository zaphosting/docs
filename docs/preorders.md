## Introduction
Some products can be ordered at ZAP-Hosting.com as pre-orders. This means that this product has not yet been integrated into our systems, but will be added in the future. The server will be set up automatically once the product has been added.

## Recognize pre-order

Pre-orders are marked as pre-orders on the product page. They will have an stopwatch icon to represent this.

## Provision of pre-orders

Pre-ordered servers will be set up fully automatically once the product is ready and set-up in our game server cloud. You will receive an email as soon as the server has been set up. The time until pre-ordered servers are installed can vary greatly, because it may depend on when server files are released. We try to install pre-ordered products as soon as it is possible.



## Payment and runtime

The 1st term of a pre-ordered product must be paid directly at the time of ordering. The 1st term begins with the provision of the server. The 2nd payment (in case of a contract or the extension of a prepaid server) is due at the end of the 1st term. A preordered server causes no further costs as long as it is not yet set up.



## Cancel your pre-ordered product
For pre-ordered servers that have not yet been set up and can still be ordered as a pre-order, the amount already paid will be refunded. For this it is sufficient to contact our support.
