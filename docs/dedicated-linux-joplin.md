## Configuration

After installing Joplin, you should configure the basic settings to adapt the application to your workflow. The configuration is accessible through the *Settings* menu.

**Synchronization**
Joplin supports multiple sync targets such as Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, or WebDAV. Select your preferred provider under ‚ÄúSynchronization‚Äù and enter your credentials. This allows you to keep notes up to date across devices.

**Encryption**
To secure your synchronized notes, enable end-to-end encryption in the ‚ÄúEncryption‚Äù settings. A key will be generated, which must be set up on all devices that access your notes.

**Editor & Appearance**
Joplin uses Markdown for notes. In the ‚ÄúEditor‚Äù settings you can define whether the preview is shown automatically and adjust font type and size.

**Plugins & Extensions**
The built-in plugin manager lets you install additional features, such as diagram support, calendar integration, or advanced tag management.

**Web Clipper**
Optionally, enable the ‚ÄúJoplin Web Clipper‚Äù browser extension to save entire web pages or selections directly as notes.

With these core settings, Joplin is ready for use in a variety of scenarios, such as task management, project documentation, or personal knowledge bases.
