## Introduction

At ZAP-Hosting we always thrive to do the best that we can, thus we welcome any feedback and suggestions from our Community. We use **[Featurebase](https://roadmap.zap-hosting.com/)** as the central platform for community feedback and product transparency.

Through Featurebase, our customers can submit ideas, vote on existing suggestions, view the current product roadmap and follow published changelogs. This system fully replaces the former Suggestions solution and provides a clearer view of how feedback moves from idea to implementation.

## Featurebase Platform Overview

Featurebase is divided into several sections that work together to provide a complete overview of product development.

### Feedback and Ideas

The Feedback section is used to collect ideas and improvement suggestions from the community. Users can submit new proposals and support existing ones by voting on them. This helps highlight which topics are most relevant to the community and deserve closer attention.

### Roadmap

The Roadmap shows the current planning state of features and ideas. It provides visibility into what is planned, what is actively being worked on, and what has already been completed. Each entry includes a clear status so progress can be followed at any time.

### Changelog

The Changelog documents completed work in a transparent and chronological way. It lists new features, improvements, and relevant changes, allowing users to see which ideas have already been delivered and when they went live.

## Submitting Feedback and Ideas

Before submitting a new idea, users should check whether a similar proposal already exists. Using the built in search helps avoid duplicates and keeps feedback consolidated. If an existing idea matches the request, voting on that entry is preferred.

New ideas can be submitted using the **Submit feedback** button in Featurebase. Each submission should have a clear title and a well explained description that outlines the problem or desired improvement. Selecting the correct category helps ensure the idea is reviewed in the right context.

## Voting and Prioritization

All ideas in Featurebase can be voted on by the community. A higher number of votes generally indicates stronger demand and increases the likelihood that an idea will be prioritized. Final decisions also take technical feasibility and overall product strategy into account.



##  Roadmap Statuses

Roadmap entries usually move through several stages. Planned items have been reviewed and scheduled, items marked as In Progress are actively being implemented, and Completed items have already been released. These statuses make it easy to understand the current state of each feature.



## Changelog

The Changelog provides a reliable overview of what has changed in the product. It includes newly released features, improvements, and other relevant updates, ensuring that progress is transparent and traceable.



## Suitable Types of Feedback

This feature is intended for product related feedback such as new game server requests, improvements to the web interface or panels, feature ideas for services, and optimizations of existing functionality. Individual support requests or technical issues should continue to be handled through the official support channels.
