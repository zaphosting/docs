## Introduction

txAdmin is a completely free to use, full-featured web panel to Manage & Monitor your FiveM server. It offers a wide range of features designed to make managing a FiveM server as easy as anything. In this guide, we will introduce you to the txAdmin interface, highlighting its features and explaining exactly what you can do with it.

## Navigation

The navigation menu includes the following items: **Players**, **History**, **Whitelist**, **Admins**, **Settings**, and **System**. Each of these will be explained in more detail below.

### Players

The Players section provides a general overview of player statistics, including the total number of players who have connected, the number of players connected in the last 24 hours, and the number of new players connected in the last 24 hours and 7 days. Below this, you'll find a list of currently connected players, along with their total playtime, first connection time, and last connection time.

Click on a player to access additional management options. Here, you can view further information, notes, history (bans/warnings), IDs (Player Identifiers, Player Hardware IDs), and the ban options.

### History

The History section lists all warnings and bans issued to players, along with detailed information about the player, the reason, and who issued or executed the warning/ban, including the date and time. You can also revoke warnings and bans from there.

### Whitelist

In the Whitelist section, you have the option to manage the whitelist function. The whitelist allows you to restrict who has access to the server. If this option is enabled in the txAdmin settings, a whitelist request is automatically created when a new player connects for the first time. You can then manage these requests accordingly in this section.

### Admins

Under the Admins section, administrators can be specified and managed. New admins can be added by clicking the **Add** button. This opens a pop-up window where you can create the account and set the appropriate permissions.
