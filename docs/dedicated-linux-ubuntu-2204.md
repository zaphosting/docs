## Preparation

For the installation and configuration of an operating system, it is initially important to mount the corresponding ISO of the operating system. There are several possible ways to mount it:

1. Mounting via the initial setup
2. Mounting via iLO (Virtual Media)
3. Mounting via iLO (Remote Console)

If you are not familiar with mounting an ISO file yet, it's best to refer to our [Initial setup](dedicated-setup.md) or [Own ISO](dedicated-iso.md) guide.



## Installation

Once the ISO has been successfully mounted and loaded, the server should be in the setup process. The language you want to use for your OS will be defined at the beginning of the setup. Select one of the available languages and confirm the selection with the `Enter` key.

Next, the appropriate keyboard layout must be selected and set for the language. Select the keyboard layout that is suitable for you here too.

Following this, the network configuration takes place. The server is configured via DHCP by default. The default network adapter is `eno1`. Confirm the default settings and continue.

An additional proxy can be configured as an option. However, this is not essential. If you do not need this, simply skip this step.

Now the Ubuntu Archive Mirror (download server for packages) is defined. Our dedicated servers are located in Germany, so it's recommended to choose the German mirror location to achieve the best possible download speed rates.

The partitions can now be defined in the storage configuration. You can either use one large partition or subdivide it if needed. If you'd like to use just the whole SSD as one partition just pick `Use an entire disk` and continue.

The setup automatically creates the volumes and you can proceed by choosing  the `Done` option.

Before the process is initiated, you will be informed that this process will delete all existing data. This message must be confirmed with the `Continue` option.

Please configure your user account to your like, you can also use the root account in the end by changing the password.
You can navigate through the options with tab or your arrow keys. When you're done proceed by ticking `Done`.

The installation of the SSH setup is recommended. If you want to manage the server via SSH, select the option to install and confirm the process.

â€‹	Ubuntu offers a few default snaps, if you'd like to use some of them, just tick the ones your like.

To complete the process, the ISO must be ejected to prevent it from being reloaded when the server is restarted. Restart the server once to finish the process.
