## Connect with FTP

First the [FTP access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) must be set up.


After this has been set up, you can now connect and open the server folder.

Here we open the `server.cfg` file in the `server-data` folder.

## Edit Config

Now we add the following above the `start essentialmode` line:

```Lua
set es_moneyIcon "$"
```

Here we can now replace the $ with our own icon.

After Saving the File and Restarting the server, the Money Icon will be changed ingame.
