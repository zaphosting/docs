## Introduction

A **domain handle** is a data record containing contact information associated with a domain and used in public WHOIS databases. It identifies the domain owner as well as administrative or technical contacts. To keep this information accurate and up to date, you can manage handles in the domain management under Handle Management by editing existing ones or creating new entries.

## Creating or Editing

In the domain management under **Handle Management**, you can either modify an existing handle or create a new one. The following fields can be configured or updated when working with a handle:

- Type (Person / Company)  
- Gender  
- First Name  
- Last Name  
- Company  
- Street / No.  
- ZIP code  
- City  
- Country  
- State / Province  
- Tax identification number  
- E-Mail Address  
- Phone  
- Fax

All changes can be entered and saved directly within the Handle Management interface. Newly created handles become available for future domain registrations or updates. Existing handles can be updated on active domains where supported by the registry.

## Conclusion

By creating or updating a domain handle, you ensure that your contact details are correctly registered with your domains. This is essential for legal compliance, reachability, and WHOIS accuracy.
