## Introduction

A server description is required for the functionality of an SCP server. The implementation of the description of the game is based on the use of Pastebin. [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) is a website where you can save texts online.

## Create Pastebin

Add the description for your server on the Pastebin page in the field under **New Paste** and then click on **Create New Paste** at the bottom. 

:::warning
Please make sure that you do not set the pastebin to private or an expiration date to avoid potential problems.

When you have followed these steps and created the pastebin, you should be redirected to the pastebin you have created. It will look like this:

## Add server description

Once the pastebin has been created, the pastebin ID must now be entered in the server configuration settings. To do this, copy the ID from the pastebin URL and then add it to the server info pastebin info text field in the **game server administration** under **Settings**.
