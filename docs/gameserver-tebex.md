## Connecting Tebex

Setting up Tebex with ZAP is very simple. The installation and configuration requires only a few steps, which are explained in more detail below. 

### Select supported game

Choose a game which is supported by Tebex and add it to your game server. Click on your game server and choose `Games` in the sidebar. Choose a supported game under `Available Games` and choose the download button to install it.

### Request Tebex invite

If the game you chose supports Tebex you will see a tab called "Tebex Shop" in the sidebar. Click on the image that appears upon loading the page.

Tebex will now sent an invite to the email address linked to your ZAP-Hosting customer account. Please follow the instructions within the email to activate your Tebex account. You will be guided through the basic configuration of your shop.

### Install the Tebex plugin

This process is normally automated. If we have no plugin for an automatic setup present on our servers or if we are missing the pingback of Tebex you will have to perform a manual setup.

### Configure the Tebex plugin

Install the appropriate game server plugin for your game manually. The setup process differs from game to game. Basic instructions on how to install the plugins can be found [here](https://docs.tebex.io/store/integrating-with-your-game-server-or-website/minecraft-java-edition).

## Verify connection with Tebex

Finally you will have to confirm that you installed the game server plugin successfully.

In some cases you may be required to enter your Tebex webstore plugin api key to establish the connection from ZAP to your Tebex store. You can then see that the connection was successfull:
