## Introduction

SFTP is a secure protocol for transferring files between computers via the Internet or a network. It stands for **‚ÄúSSH File Transfer Protocol ‚Äù** or **‚ÄúSecure File Transfer Protocol ‚Äù** and is based on the **SSH protocol (Secure Shell)**.

In contrast to FTP (File Transfer Protocol), where data is transferred unencrypted, SFTP ensures that all data is encrypted and therefore protected from unauthorized access.

## Establish connection

For the connection via **SFTP**, the login details of the root user are used. This example shows the connection setup with the WinSCP application. Create a **New session** in WinSCP.

Choose `SFTP` as **transfer protocol** in the configuration window of the new session. Next, enter the **IP address** of your server and the port **22**. For the username and password, use the login details of your `root` user.

:::warning Use of SSH keys
If you are using an SSH key instead of the simple password option, click on **Advanced** and navigate to **SSH -> Authentication**. You can save your SSH key there.
:::

The first time you connect via SFTP, this message appears because your computer does not yet know the server. Confirm with **‚ÄúYes ‚Äù** if you trust the server. This will save its security key and you will not be asked again for future connections. This is a normal step when connecting to a new server for the first time.
