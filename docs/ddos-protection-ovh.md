## Introduction

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming it with excessive inbound traffic. To ensure stable and uninterrupted operation for our customers, ZAP Hosting relies on dedicated DDoS protection systems tailored to each data center location.

One of the protection platforms integrated into our global infrastructure is the OVH Anti-DDoS system. OVH provides a fully automated, network-level mitigation solution designed to absorb even very large scale attacks without impacting service stability. This section explains how the OVH protection works and which of our products benefit from it.



## Where the Protection Is Utilized

OVH DDoS Protection is in active use at our hosting locations in London (UK), Sydney (Australia) and Singapore (Asia). At these locations, the protection covers our gameserver and voiceserver product lines, ensuring stable operation even during heavy attack scenarios.

## How the DDoS Protection Works

OVH operates a global, always-on Anti-DDoS infrastructure. Incoming traffic is permanently monitored in real time and automatically redirected to the OVH scrubbing network when an attack is detected. The scrubbing system removes malicious packets while allowing clean traffic to pass through without interruption. This process ensures that legitimate players and voice users continue to connect normally, even during active attack mitigation.

### Intelligent Network-Level Filtering
OVH employs multi layer filtering technologies that analyze traffic patterns, packet signatures and connection behaviors. Malicious traffic is filtered based on volumetric anomalies, protocol inconsistencies or suspicious packet flows. Legitimate traffic is forwarded to the server with minimal latency impact.

For gaming environments, OVH offers additional game specific filtering layers designed to protect UDP-based protocols and latency critical services. These filters include
- Protection for popular game engines and UDP game traffic
- Behavior-based detection for abnormal packet bursts
- Signature-based filtering that identifies known attack patterns
- Real time adaptation to ensure uninterrupted player connectivity

Real time communication services such as TeamSpeak benefit from OVH’s low latency filtering approach. Mitigation occurs within the backbone itself which helps maintain voice quality, connection stability and low ping.
