## Introduction

Community advertising is a great way to earn some money by advertising ZAP-Hosting. Through this program, it is essentially possible to get **free** servers. Successful advertisement which is submitted and accepted would be compensated with **€0.24** for each link.

## Important factors to consider

There are a few factors that we use to consider whether your advertisement will be accepted and successful or not. You should understand and follow each to maximise your chance of acceptance for your Community Advertisement link.

### Advertisement must be independent

We can only confirm and except advertisements where we can clearly review that it was written by the customer themself. Using the same username as your ZAP-Hosting account is sufficient when creating your advertisement.

### Comments are not considered as advertising

As an example, someone asking a question such as `"Which hosters can you recommend?"` and you replying `"ZAP is awesome!"` is not sufficient to be considered under our Community Advertising prgogram.

A successful advertisement would be more informative and extensive providing more details about our products and providing a link. 

An example of an acceptable advertisement: `"I can highly recommend ZAP-Hosting... they have, you can... they offer... which works great. Want to learn more, check out their site to see their extensive variety of products and great prices here: https://zap-hosting.com/en"`

### Advertisement must target appropriate audiences

Your advertisement should be placed in areas that would interest people in ZAP-Hosting. The entire aim of the advertisement is to draw people's attention to ZAP-Hosting and to win them as new customers therefore you should consider who the target audience is.

You must place your advertisement in appropriate places, ideally where the target audience would be interested in gameservers and hosting. As an example, a forums about gaming would be a perfect place to include an advertisement, where as a forums about agriculture would not as the target audience does not match at all.

## Submitting a Link

Submitting your link is easy. Head over to the [Community Advertising](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/communityads/) page on our ZAP-Hosting website and scroll down to the **Your Links** section.
