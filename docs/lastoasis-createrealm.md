## Introduction
Last Oasis servers require a range of setup steps to authenticate with the official site. In this guide, we will explore the steps required to create your own realm on Last Oasis and setup an oasis within your new realm.

## Preparation
One of the prerequisites to setup a new realm is to generate a key from the official site in order to be able to verify and authenticate with the official online services.

Simply, head over to [the official Last Oasis](https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/) website and login with your preferred choice of platform (Steam or Xbox).

Simply head over to the **Settings** section on your game server's webinterface and enter this code into the **Customer Key** field. Make sure to save after changing.

## Setting up provider key
You will also have to create a provider key to uniquely identify your game server. Simply use the **Add Key** button to open a menu.

Once again, head over to the **Settings** section on your game server's webinterface and enter this code into the **ProviderKey** field. Make sure to save after changing.

## Creating a Realm
You can now proceed to create a realm. On the same [official Last Oasis](https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/) website, head over to the **Realms** section and create a new Realm.

Select a name and fill out any additional details as you wish. Once ready, save the Realm. This is needed so that you can connect to your server.

Once you have created your Realm, you will be able to see an overview of the entire Realm where you can adjust any additional settings and view useful information.

## Create an Oasis
The final step is to create an Oasis within your Realm. For each game server that you own, you have to create a separate Oasis. For example, if you own 2 gameservers, you should create a separate oasis for both.

Simply press the **Manage** button in the Realm overview.

On the new page, select a desired place for your new Oasis and press **Add** to confirm.
