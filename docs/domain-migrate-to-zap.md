## Advantages

You are certainly facing the decision of which provider is right for you. Such a decision can sometimes take a lot of time. For this reason, we want to help you with your decision and share the advantages of ZAP-Hosting with you. ZAP-Hosting has been offering its services for over a decade, making it an established and experienced provider in the server hosting sector.

Our management interface allows for easy and straightforward domain management. Furthermore, we offer the ability to create subdomains for other ZAP products with just a click.

If you have decided on us, you are welcome to start transferring your existing domain to ZAP-Hosting. This process consists of three steps: preparation, where the auth code is requested; transfer, where the domain is registered and transferred to us; and necessary configuration adjustments to ensure everything works properly afterward.

## Preparation

For the transfer of an already registered domain, an **Auth Code** (short for authorization code) is necessary. This is a type of password for domains. The auth code is required when a domain is to be transferred from one provider to another. This code ensures that the domain transfer is indeed requested by the rightful domain owner.

Some providers already provide the auth code directly in the management interface. If this is not the case, you will need to inform your current provider about your desired domain transfer and request the auth code.

:::warning Validity Period

The auth code is only valid for a certain period. After this time expires, you will need to request a new auth code. The validity period depends on the respective domain extension.
:::

## Transfer 

Assuming you have your auth code, you can now proceed with ordering and registering your domain with ZAP-Hosting. Go to the order page for our [**domains**](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/domain/). Begin by filling out your personal details, followed by searching for the domain you wish to transfer.

:::info
In order to transfer a domain, you will have to extend it by 1 Year during the order process. This is standard policy across all providers.
:::

A list of your desired domain with all available domain extensions will then open. Domains that are already registered elsewhere can be identified by the gray button with the arrow.

Find the domain you wish to transfer and click on the arrow. This will open up a new prompt which is used to authorize the transfer to your ZAP-Hosting account.

Into this field, you will have to enter the **Auth Code** that you received from your previous provider during the preparation step. Once ready, submit it with the green **Add** button.

:::danger Check Input for Accuracy

Please ensure that the **Auth Code** is entered correctly and is valid. Otherwise, the order process and the domain transfer will take longer and may fail.
::: 

The domain transfer has now been initiated. The duration of the domain transfer can vary depending on the domain extension and the previous provider. Typically, a domain transfer is successfully completed within 72 hours. However, in special cases, a transfer can take more time as there are many factors that influence this.

## Configuration

If the domain has now been successfully transferred to us, you can begin configuring the domain. In the management interface of your domain, you can make changes to DNS settings or nameservers, for example. We offer additional guides for our domain products that may help you:
