To connect to your server via the Steam server browser, open the server browser from Steam. Click on `View` at the top of the Steam navigation and then on the `Game Server` section to open it. 

Search or add your server via the Steam browser by using the `IP address` and `Port` of your game server. To do this, select the `Favorites` tab in the server list and click on the plus symbol at the bottom. A pop-up window will open in which you specify your server information.
