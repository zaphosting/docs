When the installation is done, just remove the ISO-file fromy our server and press "Reboot System"

## Network

In this step we will configure our network device, to do that we need to update some files.
Please mount this iso file into your server, through the remote console or the iLO itself.

```http://185.223.30.65/dedicatedisos/centos-network-554flb.iso```

After the ISO-file was mounted successfully, we need to mount it into our system, to have access to it.

```mount /dev/sr0 /mnt```

The ISO-file was now mounted in /mnt.

```rpm -i /mnt/be2net.rpm```

Now we load the update package.

```modprobe be2net```

In this step, we will run the update, this could take a few seconds.
You can now check with `ip a s` if a network device called `eno1` exists, if yes, please reboot your system.

After the reboot was done, we can configure the network device.

```nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno1```

please fillin the following data into the file:

```
DEVICE=eno1
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
```

You can leave nano by pressing `CTRL+X` and `Y`

Now we need to start our network device with `ifup eno1` 

:::info
Your dedicated server has now a working internet connection
