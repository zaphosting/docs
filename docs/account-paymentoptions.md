## Payment process
The payment process is simple: the server configuration is put together on the configuration page, at the bottom of the page the desired payment option is selected. After a click on "Buy now", a redirection to the selected payment service provider will take place if necessary, via which the payment can be made. After receiving the payment, the server is set up within a few seconds.

## ZAP Coins: Deposit
You can deposit money into ZAP Coins using your cashbox via any of the payment options offered. Contract servers can be paid with ZAP Coins too. In the web interface you can deposit ZAP Coins under the point **Cash in** in your Cashbox.

:::info
Partial payment using ZAP Coins is not allowed. If you already have ZAP Coins, for example because you have a ZAP Coins code, you can add credit as you like. Tip: If you pay with ZAP Coins, pay attention to our Cash In Deals: If the Cash In Deal is activated, you will receive additional credit if you increase your deposit.

Transfers can be used to deposit ZAP Coins. As soon as we have received the transfer, the credit will be activated and can be used.

## Cashbox
The Cashbox can be accessed via the web interface under the item **Cashbox**. In addition to the possibility of depositing money, the Cashbox offers the following additional functions:
* **Add credit card:** Credit cards can be deposited. By depositing a credit card, it is no longer necessary to enter all data for each payment transaction when paying by credit card.
* **Deposit money:** The deposit function can also be used via the Cashbox.
* **Redeem voucher:** Vouchers that give ZAP Coins can be redeemed here. After redeeming the voucher code, the ZAP Coins are immediately credited to the account.
* **Automatically top up ZAP Coins:** ZAP Coins can be topped up automatically. This is useful if a contract server was ordered. To be able to recharge credit automatically, PayPal must be used.
* **Transaction overview:** An overview of all transactions made so far.
