## Preparation

To start the installation of **EUP**, a few preparations must first be made. To do this, [EUP](https://forum.cfx.re/t/emergency-uniform-pack-client-server-sided-easy-install-update-5-0-announcement/97599) and [NativeUI](https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua/archive/master.zip) must be downloaded and unpacked on your own computer. Once you have downloaded the files, you should have received the following ZIP files:

- `eup-ui.7z`
- `eup-stream.7z` 
- `NativeUI-master.zip`

Now unpack these files locally on your computer. It should now contain a `__resource.lua` or `fxmanifest.lua` and `script files/folders`.
