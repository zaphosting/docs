## Introduction
One of our latest additions to our ZAP-Hosting webinterface, is the ability to add default SSH Keys to your ZAP-Hosting account through our website. The awesome benefit of this is that the SSH Keys setup in your Profile page, will be automatically setup by default and used during first product setup or OS reinstallation. This saves you time as you won't have to manually setup your SSH Keys.

## Requirements
In order to use this feature, you must have an SSH Key generated. If you have an SSH Key ready, you can proceed to the next section.

To generate an SSH Key, we recommend heading over to the **Information->Access & Security** section in your vServer's webinterface.

Here, you will be able to see a green **Generate SSH Key** button. Once you press this button, your SSH Private Key will be automatically downloaded to your PC. This is the key that you will use to connect to your server once SSH is setup.

You should now store the Public Key found in the prompt as this is what you will need to submit when creating the SSH Key in your profile.
