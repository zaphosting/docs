## Introduction

Plugins allow you to expand and personalize your server even more. In the following, weâ€™ll explain where to find the most commonly used plugins and how to set them up.

## Preparation

First, youâ€™ll need to download the plugins you want to install on your server. A wide range of EXILED plugins can be found on their official GitHub page. Once youâ€™ve selected a plugin repository, youâ€™ll find a releases section where you can download the latest version. Detailed instructions on how to proceed are provided below.

While plugins can be downloaded from various sources, we recommend sticking to trusted platforms like the official GitHub repository, as these are generally considered the safest. Always exercise caution when adding plugins to your server â€“ make sure to verify the source, check the developers, and fully understand what the plugin does before installing it.

To download a plugin from GitHub, start by visiting the official [EXILED GitHub page](https://github.com/Exiled-Team) and selecting the plugin repository youâ€™d like to use.

Once inside the plugin repository, look for the **Releases** section, located on the right-hand side.

In the Releases section, you will find a downloadable **.dll** file. Click on it to start the download.

Thatâ€™s it! Once downloaded, you can proceed to the installation steps further down in this guide to learn how to install the **.dll** file onto your server.


## Installation

Once the desired plugins have been downloaded, you can proceed with the installation. This is done via **FTP**, so you will need an FTP client to upload the files to your server. If you are not yet familiar with FTP and how it works, please refer to the following guide: [Access via FTP](gameserver-ftpaccess.md).

You will find the correct plugin directory under: ```/gXXXXXX/.config/EXILED/Plugins```. Simply upload the downloaded **.dll** plugin files to this folder. It should look similar to this after uploading:

Once this step is complete, the plugin installation is finished. Finally, check the **live console** to verify that the plugin has been successfully compiled and loaded. The confirmation in the console should look like this:
