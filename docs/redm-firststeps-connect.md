The `RedM.exe` file will be downloaded. Execute the application afterwards. Once the application has loaded, Windows Explorer will open and you will need to select the directory where the `Red Dead Redemption 2` game and the `RDR2.exe` file are installed on your computer.

## Potential issues and solutions

The establishment of the connection does not work as expected? This may happen in certain situations, when the connection fails due to technical issues. We have listed the most common issues and their solutions below:

#### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully for some reason. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files. Apart from this, it should be ensured that no incorrect filter settings are used in the server list, which would ensure that the server is not displayed.
