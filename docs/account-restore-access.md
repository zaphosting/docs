## Causes & Solutions



### Login details incorrect

This message appears if the login details are incorrect, for example if an incorrect password has been provided. Common mistakes are often incorrect characters, such as a blank space or other symbols.

Make sure that you enter your password correctly. If login still does not work, you can reset your password. To do this, select the **Forgot your password?** option under the login button. You will receive an e-mail with a link that you can use to reset your password.

### Account suspended
If you receive a message when logging in that your account has been suspended and you no longer have access, there may be various reasons for this. A suspension is often due to repeated violations of our terms of use. To find out the exact reason and to check and discuss possible solutions, please contact us by e-mail at [support@zap-hosting.com](mailto:support@zap-hosting.com)



### Account deleted

If your account has been deleted in the past upon your request by a GDPR request, it cannot be restored as all data has already been completely and permanently deleted. A new account must be created in this case.

### Access to two-factor authentication lost
Identity confirmation is required to manually deactivate two-factor authentication. Please send an e-mail to [support@zap-hosting.com](mailto:support@zap-hosting.com). All further necessary steps will be explained to you there in detail. 


### Technical issues
If the above-mentioned causes have already been ruled out or do not apply, as you are not receiving any feedback or another error message, then this must be checked on a case-by-case basis. Please also get in touch with our support team.
