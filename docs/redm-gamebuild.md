Enforcing game build allows you to force a specific DLC version to your server, allowing you to play with the latest maps, clothing, vehicles and more! You can do this very simply, use the sections below based on your game server type to active it.

## RedM Linux Gameservers
In order use additional DLC content such as Cayo Perico, the Tuner DLC or Los Santos Summer Special, you must set them in the settings of your server.

You can do this either directly by editing the `server.cfg` file, or the simpler way which is to change it through the **Settings** section of your game server's webinterface.

You should now either search for `game build` or simply scroll down until you find the **Enforce Game Build** subsection. Here using the drop down menu, you can select which DLC build you wish to set your server to run on.

One you have picked your choice, head over to the bottom of the page and press the **Save** button, next proceed to restart your RedM server. Your server will now launch with the specified DLC build.
