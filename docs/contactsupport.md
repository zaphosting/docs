## Troubleshooting your problem

Your server won't start? Or you are having problems which you cannot solve alone? No problem! Our support team is here for you. 

However, before contacting our support team, we strongly recommend attempting few troubleshooting steps which may resolve or narrow down the problem.

If the product that you are having problems with is currently affected, we advise you to wait until this has been resolved. Our technicians are automatically alerted about any interruptions and will be working on solving the problem as soon as possible.

### View your logs
Another troubleshooting method is to view the logs of your server. Regardless of what game or service you are running, you should view the contents of your console or the logs subdirectory to see if any errors are present. This can different widely depending on the game and service.
