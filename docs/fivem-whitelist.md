## Introduction
You don't want to make your server accessible to everyone? There are several ways to limit the visibility and accessibility of a server. One of those possibilities is, for example, the use of a whitelist, which will be explained in the following.

The whitelist is a list that makes it possible to allow a certain selection of people. This means that only the people who are entered in the whitelist can connect. People who are not on the whitelist will not be accepted and will receive a message that they are not on the whitelist when they establish a connection.

## Configuration

To manage the whitelist feature for FiveM, you need to open the txAdmin interface. Then navigate to the **Settings** menu item and open the **Whitelist** tab.

Select the type of whitelist mode you would like to actively use. The following options are available in the administration:

- Admin-only (maintenance mode)
- Discord Server Member
- Discord Server Roles
- Approved License

This example selects and activates the **Approved License** option, which can then be used to approve players via their license.

The player licence Identifier must be whitelisted by a txAdmin administrator. This can be done through the **Whitelist page**, or the `/whitelist` command.

Provided that you have followed all the steps, your have successfully enabled and configured the whitelist for your server. For further questions or assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our support team, which is available daily to assist you! 🙂
