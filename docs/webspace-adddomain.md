## Introduction

The web space package offers the possibility to create and manage both websites and email addresses via the external Plesk interface. The web space acts as web storage. Files and folders can be uploaded via an FTP connection.

Every webspace booked through Zap-Hosting is assigned an automatically generated subdomain. This subdomain consists of the customer number, the host server and the domain "zap-webspace.com". The instructions "Link Domain" shows how your own domain can be connected to the web space.

## First steps

After the order has been completed, the web space is displayed in the Zap-Hosting Dashboard.

If you don't like the automatically generated password, you can change it on the same page using the "Change password" button directly.

As soon as the user name and password are viewed, the Plesk interface can be opened by pressing the "**Open Administration Button**" button. After being forwarded to the Plesk interface, the previously visible login data must now be entered.

The changes are confirmed by pressing the "**OK**" button. 

:::info
Confirmation may take some time. If you get errors during this change, a possible source of error would be that your domain is already created as an alias in the domain.
:::

If there were no problems with the change, this is confirmed in the Plesk interface. In order to be able to use this domain for the web space, the DNS settings must be configured in the domain management. How this works with domains ordered through us can be seen here.
