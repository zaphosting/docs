## The ZAP donation settings

With the ZAP donation function your friends can deposit money on your ZAP account with just a few clicks and thus help you to finance servers and projects. To make this work, you create a **donate link** in your account, which your friends can click on and use to deposit money.

## Create a donation link

To create a donation link for your account, click on the button for **donation settings** at the top of the interface:

Now you will be taken to the configuration page where you can set all the donation settings:

You can customize them as you like and save them with a click on **Save**.
Afterwards you can share your **donate link** with your friends or link it on your website or server.
