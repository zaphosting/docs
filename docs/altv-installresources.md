## Connect with FTP

Before resources can be installed, the [FTP-Access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) must be set up:

After this has been set up, you can now connect and open the server folder:

## Preperation

After a resource has been downloaded, it is usually ZIP packed, it must now be unpacked (e.g. with 7Zip, WinRar or WinZip)

After the resource has been unpacked, it should now contain a resource.cfg and script files / folder.

If this is not the case, they may be in a subfolder, usually with the same name.

## Upload Resources

To install resources with WinSCP, they can be uploaded to the "resources" folder using drag & drop.
It would be the same case with installing via FileZilla.

Once uploaded, the server.cfg must be opened in the gta5-altv-linux folder:

Under the remaining start entries for resources you can now add the entry for our resource, in this case "altv-speedo":

:::info
Note: There must be a comma after each line in this list, except the last one.

Then the server can be restarted and the resource should appear ingame!
