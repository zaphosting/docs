## Introduction

With the major **"Cold Fusion" update (Version 1.0)** released on **July 22, 2025**, **Abiotic Factor** now officially supports crossplay. Players on **PC (Steam)**, **PlayStation 5**, and **Xbox Series X/S** can team up and explore the depths of the research facility together no matter which platform theyâ€™re on.

Crossplay is enabled by default for all supported platforms. If needed, access can be restricted to specific platforms for example, limiting connections to PC players or a single console type.

## Manage Crossplay Settings

Crossplay platform settings can be managed directly from your game serverâ€™s **web interface**. Under the **"Settings"** section, you can define whether players may connect across all platforms or only through specific systems like **PC** or **console**. This gives you complete control over which platforms are allowed for crossplay.

## Connect via Console

Since players on PC and console cannot add each other as friends, joining a shared server requires a direct connection via the in-game server browser. Console users must ensure that Crossplay is enabled in their game settings in order to see and connect to cross-platform servers.

To begin, open Abiotic Factor on your console and navigate to the settings menu. Make sure that the `Crossplay` option is set to `Enabled`. This is essential for the server to appear in your server list when searching across platforms. It should usually be displayed the first time you start the game, asking whether you want to activate the option.

Once Crossplay is enabled, return to the main menu and select **Enter The Facility**, followed by **Join A Server**. You now have two options to connect. Either search for the server by entering its exact name into the search bar and clicking **Apply** or use the **Direct Connect** feature by entering the serverâ€™s IP address along with the port. If you use the search, the server should appear in the list below. Simply select it and click **Join** to connect.

If you're connecting via IP, ensure that the address and port are entered correctly to establish the connection successfully. Once done, youâ€™ll be placed directly into the server to begin playing.
