## Introduction

Create scheduled task that are automatically executed at defined times. This allows you to automate various processes on your server. You can specify whether the task should only be executed once or repeatedly. 



## Task types

The scheduled tasks allow you to execute different types of tasks. The following task types are currently supported: 

- Start service
- Stop service
- Restart service
- Restart server (only if it is online)
- Create backup
- Execute command

The predefined types allow you to manage your server in an extensively automated way. Especially the **Execute Command** type allows you to create many more specific and customized tasks. 

:::warning Rate limits
Certain planned tasks have rate limits, which means that they cannot be carried out an infinite number of times and instead have a cooldown/limit.

## Create tasks

Navigate to Scheduled tasks in your game server administration under Settings. To create a new scheduled task, click on the green button with the plus symbol on the right side of the list of scheduled tasks.  A new pop-up window will open where you can configure your task.

Select the option `repeating` for repetition type. In the Cron expression field, you must now specify the intervals at which the task should be executed. In this case, the service is restarted every three hours.
