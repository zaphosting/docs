## Introduction

## Configuration
In order to assign administrator rights to yourself or other players, you must first define a server admin password. This password is defined in the **Settings** of your Server, which you can find in the interface.

Inside the **Setings** page we look for "Admin Password", feel free to change it to a password of your like.

Once the password has been defined, please save the changes and restart your server once. Afterwards you can connect to your server and click on Server Settings by pressing the ESC key. There you can set the Admin Password and become an admin.
