## Supported languages

Discord bots can be programmed in different languages. Our product supports Discord Bots written in one of the following supported programming languages: 

- Java
- Python
- NodeJS

  
  

## Preparation



### Obtain Bot

To get started, youâ€™ll need a fully functional Discord bot. You can either create one yourself or download a pre-built bot from the internet. Save it to your computer so you can easily upload it to your service afterwards.

### Upload files

The files for your Discord bot need to be uploaded. This can be done using FTP. If you're unsure how to use FTP, we recommend checking out the [Access via FTP](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) guide for detailed instructions.

Provided you have opened the folder, you can now simply upload the bot files into the empty folder:

## Configuration

To be able to run your bot using the Dashboard, the bot needs to be configured in the Discord Bot Dashboard under the **Settings** page.

There you now have to configure which programming language the Bot uses, and how it's main file is called. Python 3 is used in this example and the name of the file of the Discord to be executed is specified. The file name is `main.py`.
