## Prerequisites

Before installing the **Teamspeak 6 Server**, ensure that your hosting environment meets the following requirements to guarantee a smooth installation and optimal performance.

| Hardware   | Minimum      | ZAP-Hosting Recommendation |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| CPU        | 1 vCPU Cores | 4 vCPU Cores               |

## Preparation

Before setting up the **TeamSpeak 6 Server**, you need to prepare your system. To make sure your system is running with the most recent software and security improvements, you should always perform system updates first. 

This ensures that your system has the latest security patches and software versions before proceeding.




## Installation
Now that all requirements have been met and the necessary preparations have been completed, you can proceed with the installation of the Teamspeak 6 Server application. To install the TeamSpeak 6 Server, first download the latest release file `http://teamspeak-server_win64-v6.0.0-beta6.zip/` from GitHub: [TeamSpeak 6 Server (Windows 64-bit)](https://github.com/teamspeak/teamspeak6-server/releases/download/v6.0.0%2Fbeta6/teamspeak-server_win64-v6.0.0-beta6.zip)

Next, extract the file into a directory of your choice. Open **PowerShell** and navigate to the directory where you extracted the server files. Start the server by running:

```
.\tsserver.exe
```

On the first startup, a window with the license agreement will appear, which you need to accept. After that, the Server Query Admin Account credentials and the privilege key will be displayed. These details are shown only once, so make sure to store them safely.

Once confirmed, the TeamSpeak 6 Server will already be running in the background and ready to use.

You can also adjust additional settings for the **TeamSpeak 6 Server** using **command-line arguments**. Options are passed directly when starting the server. A full list of available options can be found in the official [TeamSpeak 6 Server](https://github.com/teamspeak/teamspeak6-server/blob/main/CONFIG.md) documentation. Example:
