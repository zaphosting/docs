## Introduction

For a lot of services and programs, you have to allow external connections. This is possible by setting up a firewall.
In this guide, you will learn how to set up a firewall and allow those connections.

## Preparation

To install the firewall, you need to connect to your server via SSH. If you don't know how, you can look at our [initial access](vserver-linux-ssh.md) guide.
After connecting, you should update the server by using `apt update` and `apt upgrade`.

## Using UFW (Easy) 

There are multiple firewall programs for Linux, this guide will focus on the 2 most popular ones: UFW and IPTables.
We will start with UFW, as it is easier to set up and manage.

### Installing UFW

You can install UFW simply via APT using `sudo apt install ufw`.
To not loose the connection via SSH, you should not activate it yet, first you have to set it up.

### Setting up UFW

We recommend using the following policies by default:

`sudo ufw default deny incoming`
and
`sudo ufw default allow outgoing`

Now you should allow the SSH connection and any other port you want to open now:

`sudo ufw allow 22` for SSH

`sudo ufw allow 80` example for HTTP

`sudo ufw allow 25565` example for a Minecraft Server


To enable UFW, you have to run `sudo ufw enable`. You can always open more ports, if needed, using `sudo ufw allow PORT`


### Add Port Forwardings

To forward a port, you can simply use this command:

For TCP ports:

`sudo ufw allow PORT/tcp` replacing PORT with the port you want to forward.

Example: `sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp` for a Minecraft server

For UDP ports:

`sudo ufw allow PORT/udp` replacing PORT with the port you want to forward.

Example: `sudo ufw allow 9987/udp` for a TeamSpeak 3 server

### List and remove Port Forwardings

To display all port rules, you can run `sudo ufw status numbered`. If you want to remove a rule, you can `sudo ufw delete NUMBER`, using the number of the rule in the list.

## Installing IPTables (Advanced)

Most System already include IPTables by default, but to make sure you can run `sudo apt install iptables`.

### Setting up IPTables

First, set the default policies and settings:

`sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP` to disallow all incoming connections

`sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP` to disallow all forwardings

`sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT` to accept all outgoing connections

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT` to allow the loopback

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT` to allow all existing connections

Now you should allow the SSH connection and any other port you want to open now:

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT` for SSH

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT` example for HTTP

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -j ACCEPT` example for a Minecraft Server

Then you have to make the rules persistent, so they are still active after you restart the server. Install the IPTables persistent package using `sudo apt install iptables-persistent`. Then apply it using `sudo netfilter-persistent save`. And add it to the autostart with `sudo systemctl enable netfilter-persistent`.

### Add Port Forwardings

To forward a port, you can simply use this command:

For TCP ports:

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport PORT -j ACCEPT` replacing PORT with the port you want to forward.

Example: `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -j ACCEPT` for a Minecraft server

For UDP ports:

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport PORT -j ACCEPT` replacing PORT with the port you want to forward.

Example: `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 9987 -j ACCEPT` for a TeamSpeak 3 server


### List and remove Port Forwardings

You can display all rules using this command: `sudo iptables -L --line-numbers`. If you want to remove a rule, you use `sudo iptables -D INPUT NUMBER` replacing `NUMBER` with the one from the list you want to remove.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed a firewall on your Linux server and created your very own port rules. You can also use this guide for forwarding more ports.
