## Preparation
Begin by heading over to [the official Last Oasis](https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/) website and logging in with your preferred choice of platform (Steam or Xbox).

## Enabling multi hosting
On the website, head over to the **Realms** section. On your current Realm, press the **Change** button and switch the hosting mode from **Single -> Multiple**.

:::info
In order to be able to run multiple Oases at the same time, you must rent one game server per Oasis. You should use the same provider key as the original server for each new server. Make sure to restart your server after changes.

After you perform this change, you will be able to manage the Oases using the **Manage** button under this section.

## Create a new Oasis
Proceed by selecting a desired place for the new Oasis and press **Add** to confirm.
