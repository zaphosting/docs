## Requirements

No additional software is used for the game by default. However, if you want to use mods on your server, then it is worth using the [DZSA Launcher](https://dayzsalauncher.com/). 



## Obtain server details

You will require all the relevant information necessary to connect to your server. The information about your server can be found on the dashboard of your game server's web interface panel. Important information includes the following

- IP address and port
- Server name
- Server password (Optional)

Using the information mentioned above, you should be able to locate your server and ensure that you connect to the correct server.

:::warning DayZ server not listed
The server list in the game is known for not being the most reliable. It may be that your server is not listed temporarily. In this case, use an alternative connection method.

<TabItem value="connect_solution_server_browser_expext" label="Server Browser (Experimental & Extern)">

If you are using the experimental version of DayZ, you can connect to your server via the DayZ Launcher. To do this, start the launcher and open **Servers**. Click on the **Direct connect** button and enter the IP address and port of your server.

<TabItem value="connect_solution_dzsa" label="DZSA Launcher (Extern)">

The official server list is unreliable or you are using mods? Then it's worth using the DZSA Launcher instead. Open the launcher and use the filters on the left to search for your server using the server name. 

:::warning Register your server
 Your server is not registered with the DZSA Launcher by default. We generally recommend registering the server there, as many users use this server list instead. Press [here](https://dayzsalauncher.com/#/servercheck) to register your server.
