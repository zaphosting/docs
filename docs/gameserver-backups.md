We offer the possibility to create individual backups per click. This allows you to create backups easily and without much effort as well as import them at any time later. We offer this feature for the server files of your game server as well as for the associated databases. All backups are stored on your storage server, which includes 10GB free storage space by default. If you need more, then you can also upgrade to Premium Storage.

Besides creating backups manually, backups can also be created fully automatically. Backups can be created either daily or weekly at a specified time. After restoring a backup, the server will be at the state at the time of backup creation.




## Create backups manually

Depending on the game, it's usually also a good idea to back up the database as well, since important data such as scores, permissions and much more is often stored there. 

>⚠️ Having sufficient storage space is essential for creating regular backups. Make sure that you always have enough storage available. 




## Download/delete backups

If you want to download or delete backups you have to connect to the storage server via FTP. Here you can find instructions to use FTP: [FTP access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md)
