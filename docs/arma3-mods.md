## Connect to FTP

Before resources can be installed, the [FTP access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) must be set up.

After this has been set up, you can now connect and open the server folder:

## Preparation

To install mods on the server, we first have to subscribe to them in the Steam workshop:

Now we start the ArmA 3 Launcher, so that the mods are created in the game folder, after the mods are processed in the launcher we can close the launcher again.

Now we open our ArmA 3 folder, here is a "!Workshop" folder, there are our mods:

## Upload Mods


To install mods with WinSCP, they can be uploaded to the arma3 folder via drag&drop

After this has been uploaded, we then need to open the mod folder and move all data under `keys` to the folder with the same name on your server.

## Activate Mods

Now we open the settings of our game server, under the "Mods" setting we enter our mods as follows

```
@mod1;@mod2;@mod3
```

In our case the whole thing looks like this:

Make sure that for multiple mods a ; is set between the entries:

Done! After a server restart the mods are active.
