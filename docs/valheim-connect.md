To connect to your Valheim server, we first open our web interface and make sure we have set a secure password in the settings:

Note: Without the password your Valheim server will not start.

After setting the password we can start the server, it may take a few minutes until it switches to "Online":

To connect to the Valheim server directly, we need to open the server list in Steam:

Here we now add our server as follows:

:::info
Note: The Port has to be calculated with +1 at the end, that means if your port is 27043, you need to enter 27044 in Steam.
:::

After adding this, we should now see our server in the server list:

Now we can connect directly to the server via the "Connect" button.


## Connect using the Server List
First we open Valheim and click on `Start Game`, if you do not have a Character yet, one has to be created now, then we will click on `Start`


Here we do not want to create a new World, so we press "Cancel"

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/ZnKWT8eXCcArMwX/preview)

Now we can click on `Join Game` at the top of the Menu and Enter our Servername in the "Filter" Section, we will also set a Checkmark at "Community"

:::info
If you do not see your Server yet, make sure to wait a bit, depending on the amount of Servers, a refresh can take a few Minutes.
:::

Now we should already see our Server in the List, we can now click on it and then click on `Connect`, once we have connected we now just need to enter the Server Password we gave it in the Settings and press Enter!

Done! You can now play the game on your very own Valheim Server!
