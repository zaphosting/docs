:::info
**Difference Between Contracts and Prepaids**: Contracts are automatically renewed and must be terminated. Prepaids simply expire after the booked time, as long as they are not extended manually.

## My contracts
All server products for which you selected "**Contract**" as "**Billing type**" during the order process will automatically renew unless you cancel them.
