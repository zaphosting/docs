## Introduction

Get to know how to install Sourcemod and Metamod and how to use plugins for your server. Both extensions allow you to customize games like CS:S, CS:GO, DoD:S, or TF2 and significantly expand the available server management options. 

With Sourcemod and Metamod, you can add plugins, enable special features, and tailor your server exactly to your preferences.

## Sourcemod / Metamod installation

### Preparation

The required extensions can be downloaded from [Sourcemod](https://sourcemod.net/) and [Metamod](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=stable). Always use the latest **stable** versions to ensure full functionality and compatibility.

You need the Linux packages **Sourcemod** and **Metamod**. Download them from the specified source. After downloading, you should have two compressed files. Extract them on your computer to get an addons directory containing the `sourcemod` and `metamod` folders.

### Installation

Once the above steps are completed, you can proceed with the installation. Upload the files to your server via FTP using an FTP client. If you are unfamiliar with FTP and how it works, refer to the following guide: [Access via FTP](gameserver-ftpaccess.md)

Next, upload the **addons** folder to the main directory of your server. The folder structure should then look like this:

```
/gxxxxxx/dods/dod/addons
```

The setup of **Sourcemod** and **Metamod** is now complete. You can connect to your server in the game and use the ``sm version`` command in the console to check if Sourcemod and Metamod was successfully installed. The output should look like this:

```

## Plugins installation

### Preparation

Once Sourcemod and Metamod are installed and working properly, you can begin adding plugins. Download the plugins you want to install on your server from [Sourcemod](https://sourcemod.net/), where youâ€™ll find a large and growing collection published over the years. For each plugin, make sure to obtain the corresponding .smx file.

### Installation

Once you have downloaded the desired plugins, you can proceed with their installation. This is done via FTP by uploading the plugin files to the directory:

```
../addons/sourcemod/plugins/
```
