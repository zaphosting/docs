Additional details are also available to support effective management and monitoring of the server.

### Statistics

The statistics page provides insights into the usage of the server. For example, it shows how many users have connected to the server over the past minutes or days. To ensure meaningful data is displayed, the server must have been running for a certain period of time. Statistics become available only after enough information has been collected.

### DDoS Manager

View past DDoS attacks to better assess potential threats and patterns. Enable notifications for ongoing DDoS attacks on your server to react quickly when an incident occurs.

Depending on the server location and the DDoS protection available there, you can also monitor active attacks in real time. This includes detailed traffic insights, showing both legitimate traffic and the amount of traffic blocked by the mitigation systems. This level of transparency helps you understand how the protection is working and enables you to identify potential risks early.

:::info DDoS manager access missing?
Use of the DDoS Manager requires the additional option "DDoS Manager Overview". If your current package does not include these components, you can add them at any time by upgrading your service.

### Event Log

The event log provides a comprehensive overview of all activities related to server administration.

This logging function helps ensure complete documentation of changes and events and supports faster identification of potential issues.

### Privilege Keys

To obtain certain permissions on the TeamSpeak server, a privilege key is required. This key, also known as a token, is entered directly on the server and grants access to predefined permission levels. These keys can be created, managed, and removed as needed.

### TSDNS

The ZAP TSDNS module allows the creation of custom connection addresses for the TeamSpeak server. TS DNS aliases can be set up as subdomains on a domain provided by ZAP or on your own domain hosted through the web interface. When using such an alias to connect, there is no longer any need to enter the port manually because the address will automatically lead to the correct server.

## Tools

The tools section offers various functions for managing the server. One of these is the ability to create backups in the form of snapshots. 

### Snapshots

Backups of the TeamSpeak 3 server allow for a complete snapshot of the current server state. All existing channels, registered users, and permission settings are reliably saved. These snapshots provide an effective way to restore the server to a previous state if needed for example, after structural changes or accidental configuration errors.
