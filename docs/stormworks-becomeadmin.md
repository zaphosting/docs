## Introduction
The assignment of administrator permissions allows you simple and comprehensive administration with full control of your server. As an administrator, you have the option of using all available options and functions provided by the game directly in the game. All the steps you need to take to assign administrator permissions for your server will be described below.

### Configuration

Click on "Configs" under Settings in the web interface of your game server:

You will now see the "Stormworks server_config.xml". Click on the blue pencil to modify it:

![752-69-max](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/n7MdydSkB2CaBmW/preview)

Afterwards you can add a Steam64ID in the section "admin", which should get admin rights:

If you are planning to add more admins, add them one by one:

Once you have entered the admins, you can save the config with the "Save" button:
