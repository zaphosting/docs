### You can become an admin on your Stormwork server as follows:

Click on "Configs" under Settings in the web interface of your game server:

You will now see the "Stormworks server_config.xml". Click on the blue pencil to modify it:

Afterwards you can add a Steam64ID in the section "admin", which should get admin rights:

If you are planning to add more admins, add them one by one:

Once you have entered the admins, you can save the config with the "Save" button:

Restart your server now, to ensure that all registered Steam64IDs will get their admin permissions.
