## Introduction

The ZAP-Hosting website interface is designed to support multiple languages, ensuring that users from different regions can comfortably access and navigate all services. Whether browsing product pages, managing servers, or handling support requests, using the platform in a familiar language significantly improves clarity, usability, and overall experience.


## Change the Language

A language icon is located at the top right corner of the website, represented by a flag such as ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª or ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ depending on the current selection. Clicking this icon opens a list of supported languages. After selecting a language, the page reloads automatically and all content is displayed in the chosen language.
