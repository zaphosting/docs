## Introduction

The Cashbox is the central area for managing your account balance. It allows you to deposit money, manage stored payment methods, configure automatic cash ins, redeem vouchers, and review all balance related account entries in one place.



## Available cash in options

The Cashbox provides multiple options for depositing money into your account. All currently available payment methods are displayed directly in this section. To start a deposit, click on **Cash in**.

## Saving a credit card

You can store a credit card for future payments or for use with automatic cash ins. This allows faster deposits without re entering your payment details each time. To add a credit card, click on **Add credit card**. A new window will open where you can enter your credit card details. Complete all required fields and confirm the process to save the card.

## Activating automatic payments

Automatic payments allow your account balance to be refilled automatically when it drops below a defined threshold. To enable this feature, click on **Cash in automatically**. You can then define the minimum balance at which the cash in is triggered and the amount that will be credited to your account.
