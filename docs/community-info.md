At ZAP-Hosting, we value our awesome community from all around the world, from server owners, all the way to creatives and developers, everyone is welcome! 👋

## Community Features

We are established on a wide range of mainstream platforms, including Discord, Reddit, X and the list goes on... in fact we are likely on most of them! Our community presence is also spread wide! ⚡

### Events & Competitions

We regularly host events & competitions across many of our socials. We typically host livestreams bi-weekly alongside frequent game events where we play with our community, as well as competitions which are not strictly limited to gaming! Take for example our recent banner competition for our Discord server, or our Minecraft Parkour Challenge... our competitions are always great fun with the added bonus of freebies being handed out to our community! 🏆

Our livestreams take place on our [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/zaphosting) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/zaphosting) whilst our game competitions are typically hosted on our [ZAP-Hosting Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/invite/zaphosting). 🎥

Both our events and competitions are always filled with freebies such as money for your cashbox, free products as well as of course... being filled with much fun by us and the community! 🪙

We hope to see you at one of our events or competitions in the future! ⚔️
