## Introduction

With the **ProfiDNS function** you can create additional entries (records) for your domain, which you cannot do with the EasyDNS option or if you want to create the desired entries for your domain yourself.

## Where do I find the ProfiDNS Option and how do I use it?

The option will be displayed, as long as you click on the desired domain in the interface.
If you then scroll down a little, the 3 available options are displayed.
The check mark at ProfiDNS must be clicked + saved so that you can make the entries in the DNS administration afterwards.
