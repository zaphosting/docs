## Introduction

The **ProfiDNS option** offers the possibility to make advanced configurations to the DNS settings. This allows you to link to ZAP-Hosting's own services as well as to other external services. The possibilities are therefore endless.

## Access and use case

To access and activate the EasyDNS option, you must open the administration of your domain in the web interface. Once there, you will see the following options under DNS administration:

- EasyDNS
- ProfiDNS
- ExpertDNS

The **EasyDNS** option should be selected by default. So you must first select and activate the **ProfiDNS** option.

You can manage the DNS records under **DNS Administration** in the domain administration under Settings. New records can be created or existing ones can be adjusted/deleted there.
