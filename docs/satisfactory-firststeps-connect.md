## Preparation

First of all, it is necessary to clarify which prerequisites have to be met so that a connection to the server is possible. This includes, for example, the game, additional content (extensions) and the general server information such as IP address, port and server name.



### Game / Contents

For the connection to your game server, it is mandatory that you already own the game. This is not provided by us when renting a server. Apart from that, no other content is required for the use.



### Server Information

Provided that all prerequisites of **Game / Content** are met, you will need the information of your server. Click on your game server service in your dashboard. The overview will now show you all general information about your server.

The relevant information includes the **IP address,** and **Port**. You should remember these, because you will need them for your first connection to your server.



## Connect to the server

Once all the prerequisites have been met, you can begin to connect to the server. To do this, start your game. Then navigate to the menu item Server Manager in the game and click on "Add Server" to add your server.

A popup window will open where the server information is entered. Enter the IP address and port of your game server and click **Confirm**. The game will ask you to set a name and admin password afterwards.

The next and last step is to create a **Savegame**. This can be done by clicking on the **Create Game** tab on the added server and selecting the name and type of world.

## Potential problems and solutions

The establishment of the connection does not work as expected? This may happen in certain situations, when the connection fails due to a technical problem. We have listed the most common problems and their solutions below:



### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files.
