## Preparation

Before setting up the **Speedtest CLI**, you need to prepare your system. This includes updating your operating system to the latest version. These preparations ensure a stable environment and help prevent issues during or after the installation.


### Update System
To make sure your system is running with the most recent software and security improvements, you should always perform system updates first. This ensures that your system has the latest security patches and software versions before proceeding.



## Installation

Now that the necessary preparations have been completed, you can proceed with the installation of the Speedtest CLI application. To do so, download the Speedtest CLI for Windows (x64) here: https://install.speedtest.net/app/cli/ookla-speedtest-1.2.0-win64.zip

## Configuration

speedtest-cli does not rely on a traditional configuration file but can be customized using command-line options and environment variables. This allows you to adapt it for consistent and automated use:

- `--server <ID>`: Select a specific server by its ID for more consistent and comparable test results.  
- `--bytes`: Display speeds in bytes per second instead of bits.  
- `--simple`: Output only ping, download, and upload values in a compact format.  
- `--json` or `--csv`: Useful for automation and logging, as results are stored in a machine-readable format.  
- Proxy support: Configure environment variables like `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` to run speedtest-cli behind a proxy.  

For repeated use with the same options, itâ€™s convenient to create a shell alias or a small wrapper script. This way, you can run speedtest-cli quickly while ensuring uniform output.
