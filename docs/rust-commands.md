Rust has a wide range of different commands available for server owners and players to use. On this page, we summarise the most useful and popular ones which are used for server settings, player administrating and to control players.

:::info
Some commands require the use of a player's Steam64 ID. Use the small tutorial below to understand how to get a player's Steam ID.
:::

## Getting your Steam ID
Firstly, use use a tool like the [Steam ID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/) to get your Steam64 ID.

Here you enter your Steam URL:

Then press `Find Steam ID`. Now we should be able to see our Steam Profile, here we copy our "Steam64ID (Dec)".

And that is it, now you have the Steam64 ID and can use it for the commands which require Steam64 ID below.

## Command Categories

Use the section tabs below to switch between each category. The tables consist of the command itself, the accepted values for the command (if applicable) and a description to make it easier to understand.

Any command which is mentioned on this page is for vanilla Rust.
