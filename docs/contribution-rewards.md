Across our Contribution Program, we are pleased to be able to provide **money rewards** as an awesome benefit for successfully contributing! We offer reward payouts through PayPal and as credit for your ZAP-Hosting account. Rewards are provided as the final step once your contribution is approved by our ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team and is ready to be published.

Another great benefit is an exclusive **@Community Contributor** role which you will receive on our [ZAP-Hosting Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/zaphosting) for your first contribution, to show off your efforts in supporting the community and to gain access to some exclusive content. You must provide your Discord ID during the submission process if you wish to receive this.

There are a range of criteria that we use to calculate the final reward, and this differs between the type of contribution that you performed. In the following sections, you can view more detailed information regarding rewards for each of our Contribution sections.

## Contribution Type

:::tip
During evaluation, we calculate a base payout which is applicable for the PayPal option. If the writer decides to choose ZAP-Hosting Credit as their payout option, we will add 30% to their total payout as a bonus.

Example: We evaluate a base payout of €40 for your contribution. You will receive €40 if you choose the PayPal option or €46 (40 * 1.3) for the ZAP-Hosting Credit option.

### ZAP Guides

For ZAP Guides contributions, we first consider if the changes are a new guide or updates to an existing guide. Typically, this can be assumed based on your guide suggestion. If an existing guide was modified very significantly, we may consider this as a new guide however, this is at the discretion of the ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team.

#### New Guides

| ------------------ | -------------- |
| ZAP-Hosting Credit | €65            |

#### Updates to existing guides

| ZAP-Hosting Credit | €26            |

| PayPal             | €100            |

## Evaluation Criteria

There is a range of criteria that we use to evaluate the value of the final payout. These are listed below as follows:
- Technical Quality: Is the content written professionally? Is it using the latest most accurate information? Are keywords appropriately used?
- Topic Involved: Are there many similar topics on the internet? Is the topic unique?
- Thoroughness: Is the content heavily detailed and directly addresses everything that the reader needs to know?
- Guidelines: To what extent has the writer followed our guidelines?
- Post-review Changes: How much change was necessary to ensure a high-quality guide? How much did the ZAP Contributions Team have to help?

Based on these criteria, we approximate an acceptable reward for the work the writer has put into the guide. We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible, so we always welcome feedback and responses from the writer if they are dissatisfied and wish to discuss their rewards and work in further detail.

## Receiving the Reward

Once you have submitted and finalized your contribution with our ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team, we will evaluate and inform you about your reward. This will be through the GitHub Pull Request for guide contributions and through the ticket on your ZAP-Hosting.com account for blog contributions.

### ZAP-Hosting Credit (ZAP Coins)
In the case of choosing ZAP-Hosting Credit as the payout, we will directly credit the approved amount to your specified ZAP-Hosting.com account.

### PayPal
