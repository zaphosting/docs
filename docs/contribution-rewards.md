After ensuring that you follow our processes correctly, the final step involves publishing your changes and of course geting rewarded for it!

We reward our authors of new content up to 75€ paid out in ZAP Coins to the provided zap-hosting.com account upon creating a suggestion issue. Improvements to existing documentation content is typically rewarded within the 25€ region. The exact reward that you receive will depend on a range of factors including the quality, thoroughness and complexity of the changes that you have produced. The reward will be evaluated by a member of the ZAP-Hosting docs team once you submit a Pull Request for your topic that has been approved. You will also be sent a contract to sign which lets us publish your work on our documentation site for the evaluated reward.

:::note

All rewards are under the discretion of the ZAP-Hosting docs team.
