Across our Contribution Program, we provide rewards in the form of ZAP Coins which can be used on our website. Rewards are provided as a final step once your contribution is ready to be published and approved by our ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team.

:::info
Another great benefit is an exclusive **@Community Contributor** role which you will receive on our [ZAP-Hosting Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/zaphosting) for your first contribution, to show off your efforts in supporting the community and to gain access to some exclusive content. You must provide your Discord ID during the submission process if you wish to receive this.

There are a range of criteria that we use to calculate the final reward, and this differs between the type of contribution that you performed. In the following sections, you can view more detailed information regarding rewards for each of our Contribution sections.

All final decisions including for rewards are at the discretion of the ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team.

## ZAP Guides

For ZAP Guides contributions, we first consider if the changes are a new guide or updates to an existing guide. Typically, this can be assumed based on your guide suggestion. If an existing guide was modified very significantly, we may consider this as a new guide however, this is at the discretion of the ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team.

- **New guides** qualify for a maximum of **€65 ZAP Coins**. 
- **Updates to existing guides** qualify for a maximum of **€25 ZAP Coins**.

## ZAP Blogs

For ZAP Blogs contributions, writers qualify for a maximum of **€100 ZAP Coins** as their reward.

## Evaluation Criteria

There is a range of criteria that we use to evaluate the value of the final payout. These are listed below as follows:
- Technical Quality: Is the content written professionally? Is it using the latest most accurate information? Are keywords appropriately used?
- Topic Involved: Are there many similar topics on the internet? Is the topic unique?
- Thoroughness: Is the content heavily detailed and directly addresses everything that the reader needs to know?
- Guidelines: To what extent has the writer followed our guidelines?
- Post-review Changes: How much change was necessary to ensure a high-quality guide? How much did the ZAP Contributions Team have to help?

Based on these criteria, we approximate an acceptable reward for the work the writer has put into the guide. We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible, so we always welcome feedback and responses from the writer if they are dissatisfied and wish to discuss their rewards and work in further detail.

## Receiving the Reward

Once you have submitted and finalized your contribution with our ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team, we will evaluate and inform you about your reward. This will be through the GitHub Pull Request for guide contributions and through the ticket on your ZAP-Hosting.com account for blog contributions.

We will directly credit the approved ZAP Coins to your specified account. Once this occurs, you agree to transfer all exclusive intellectual property rights of your creation to ZAP-Hosting GmbH & Co KG. This transfer is confirmed once you have received your payment.
