You will receive an e-mail to your current e-mail address with the subject ‚ÄúChange of your e-mail address at ZAP-Hosting‚Äù, where you have to confirm this change.

To complete the update, you must confirm the change by clicking the link in that email. Only after this confirmation will your new email address be applied to your account.
