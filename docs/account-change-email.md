## Introduction

If you wish to update the email address linked to your ZAP-Hosting account, you can do so at any time through your account settings. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps.

## Change E-Mail-Address

Open the [account settings](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/home/profile/) of your ZAP-Hosting account and scroll down until you see the **Change email address** section. Once you’ve located it, click the corresponding button to proceed.

A pop-up window will open where you have to enter your new e-mail address. Enter the e-mail address in the field and confirm the input by clicking on **Submit**.

You will receive an e-mail to your current e-mail address with the subject “Change of your e-mail address at ZAP-Hosting”, where you have to confirm this change.

To complete the update, you must confirm the change by clicking the link in that email. Only after this confirmation will your new email address be applied to your account.
