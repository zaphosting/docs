![Contribution Program 2.0](https://github.com/zaphosting/docs/assets/42719082/72b1c56c-543c-46fe-9f4a-0d59e27bb35e)

## Introduction

Here at ZAP-Hosting, we believe in the power of our Community, thus we are pleased to run our very own ZAP-Hosting Community Contributions program. This program enables our ZAP Community to produce high-quality, practical and easily accessible guides to support a wide range of topics and help out other fellow people. The program also supports creativity from our Community through the creation of unique Blog posts and content

All content produced under this program provides rewards in the form of ZAP Coins as an awesome benefit! You can view more information about rewards as well as the criteria used for evaluating rewards via the [Contribution Rewards guide](contribution-rewards.md).

Our program currently accepts contributions in **English**.

## What qualifies for this program?

We are pleased to have expanded our program to cover new areas in response to great engagement and feedback from the Community. These areas of interest are briefly presented below alongside a link to their dedicated guide page where you can view further information.

### ZAP Guides - Creating & Updating Guides

Our ZAP Guides contribution section involves creating content for our guides on our official [ZAP-Hosting Docs](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/). This involves creating brand new guides but also covers updates and expansions to existing guides where deemed necessary.

Interested in Contributing to our Guides? Head over to our dedicated [Guides Process Guide](contribution-guides.md) to learn more.

### ZAP Blogs - Writing Blog Posts

We are pleased to introduce blog posts as our latest area of interest for our contribution program. This is a very exciting opportunity that involves writing your very own informative blog posts for our official [ZAP-Hosting.com Blog](https://zap-hosting.com/en/blog/).

## Who is this program for?

The contribution program is accessible to anyone who wants to share their knowledge and experience with the community! We actively look for dedicated writers who have strong technical skills and are knowledgeable in their respective field. Most importantly, we look for writers who are dedicated and are happy to collaborate with our ZAP-Hosting Contributions Team to improve and revise their content before publishing.

## Provision of Temporary Services

On request and if necessary, we may provide services that are needed to create a guide or blog post for a limited period of time. Through server provisioning, we want to improve accessibility to necessary products to allow people to write about topics for which they may not have an active server with us.

You can request a service through the respective submission process that you are using, under one of the questions.

The provisioning depends on a few factors. For example, the activity of your ZAP-Hosting account is evaluated, how active you have already been in terms of the contribution program, and whether provisioning by us is necessary for the planned content. If a service is provided, it will be made available to you free of charge for a limited period of time. The provision is limited to a few days depending on the scope of the content and the required service.
