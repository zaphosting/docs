## ZAP-Hosting docs contribution program
We believe in the power of community, which is why we run our own ZAP-Hosting docs contribution program which enables our community to produce high-quality, practical and easily accessible guides to support a wide range of topics and help out other fellow people globally. Of course, it also comes with the sweet benefit of ZAP Coins as a reward!

Our contribution program currently only accepts contributions in English. In order to comply with copyright laws, we cannot accept content from other sources. All content that is produced under our contribution program must be original work produced by you.

## What qualifies for this program?
Under our contribution program, we currently accept updates and expansion to existing content, as well as new pages and content that you add to the documentation. The reward for the contribution will depend on a few factors, but primarily depends on the quantity and quality of the content and changes that you have produced. You can earn as much as €75 in ZAP Coins for the creation of a new page within our ZAP-Hosting Documentation!

Please check out the other pages in this section to understand the process for contributing, our guidelines and the rewards in more details prior to performing any contributions.

## Who is this program for?
The contribution program is accessible to anyone who wants to share their knowledge and experience with the community! We actively look for dedicated writers who have strong technical skills and are knowledgeable in the respective field. Most importantly, we look for writers who are dedicated and are happy in collaborating with our ZAP-Hosting docs team to improve and revise their content prior to publishing.
