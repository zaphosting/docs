## Potential issues and solutions

The connection to a game server can often be established in one or more ways. Available methods are described and explained in detail below.

#### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files. Apart from this, it should be ensured that no incorrect filter settings are used in the server list, which would ensure that the server is not displayed.
