## Server information

To establish the connection to your server, the IP address and the port is required. This information can be viewed and copied in the dashboard of your game server administration.

## Establishing connection

Deadlock doesn't support any form of server list at the moment, which is why a connection to your server is only possible via the developer console. The key assignment for this is the **F7** key by default. Open it and execute the following command with your own server information: 

```
connect <ip-address:port>
```

Once the command has been executed, the connection to the server is established and the console can be closed again.

## Potential issues and solutions

The establishment of the connection does not work as expected? This may happen in certain situations, when the connection fails due to a technical problem. We have listed the most common problems and their solutions below:

### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully for some reason. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files.
