## Configuration

Additional cars are added to the job garages via FTP. To do this, connect to your game server via FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP yet, please have a look at our [FTP access](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) guide. 

Once you are connected via FTP, navigate to the ESX resource folder and open the esx_addons folder. The folder structure should look like this: `/gXXXXXX/fivem/ESXLegacy_XXXXXX.base/resources/[esx_addons]`

Now select either the Ambulance or Police job, for example, and open the `config.lua` configuration file from the resources.

In the configuration file, the section of `Config.AuthorizedVehicles` has to be adjusted. You can search for it using the search feature and then adjust or extend it according to your wishes:
