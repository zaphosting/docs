## Introduction
Found a voucher code which you wish to redeem as money to your cashbox (ZAP Coins) or to use as a discount for one of your servers? Have a look through this guide to understand how to redeem the applicable discount code.

To begin, you should login or register on our website in order to be able to use codes. This can be done very quickly and easily through the top login panel.

As soon as you are logged in, you will automatically land in your webinterface. In order to be able to use a code, you should first find out what kind of code you want to redeem.

There are two different types of coupon codes:
- Codes that increase your ZAP Coins (**voucher codes**)
- Codes that reduce the price of an order (**discount codes**)

## Voucher ZAP Coin codes
Voucher ZAP coin codes can be redeemed very easily through your webinterface panel. Simply head over to your **Cashbox** by pressing the ZAP Coins text at the top of your web interface.

Once you are in on your **Cashbox** page, scroll down to the blue **Use Voucher** button. Press the button to open up a menu.

Here you can enter the voucher code that you received. Once ready, press the green **Use voucher** button in order to submit it.

If the voucher was valid and is correct, you will receive an success message letting you know it worked.

Otherwise, if a code does not work, it may be that it has already expired, has already been used or that the code is not a voucher credit code.

:::tip
You can also scroll down to the bottom of the **Cashbox** to see which voucher codes you have redeemed within any time period.

## Discount codes
Discount codes work similar to credit codes, but are used elsewhere in the webinterface. They reduce the cost of the package you want to book during the ordering process.

Firstly, find the product that you wish to order on our website and configure it to your likings within our server configurator.

Once everything is configured correctly, you can now use your code in the ordering process. Scroll down to the bottom, select your payment method, and simply click the **Redeem voucher** text below the order total.

As soon as you use the voucher, you will see the new updated price appear. However, if you receive an error there may be a few reasons for this. It could be that the code has reached its max usage limit, the code has expired or that the code can only be used on certain products or payment methods. The error message should explain the issue.

There are two different discount codes: 
- Codes that reduce the cost of the first booked period
- Codes that permanently reduce costs during the runtime
