## Introduction

Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Dedicated Servers are among the most popular hosting options for a wide range of use cases. While both offer full root access and a high degree of flexibility, they differ significantly in terms of performance, resource allocation, and hardware access. Understand the key differences so you can choose the right solution for your needs.

## Differences

A VPS is a virtual machine that shares physical hardware resources with other VPS instances on the same host system. CPU, RAM, and disk space are pre-allocated, ensuring performance within defined limits. This makes it ideal for smaller to medium-sized projects with predictable requirements.

A Dedicated Server, on the other hand, gives you access to the full physical hardware exclusively. No resources are shared â€“ all CPU cores, memory, and I/O are reserved for your system. This results in consistent, guaranteed performance, making it perfect for compute-heavy or business-critical applications. You can also install custom ISO images and use fully customized operating systems.

The table below provides a technical comparison of the three product categories:

## Conclusion

A VPS is a great choice if you're looking for a cost-effective and flexible server with predictable performance â€“ ideal for websites, smaller gameservers, bots, or apps with moderate needs. The assigned performance is reliable and clearly defined.

A Dedicated Server is recommended for demanding use cases where consistent high performance and full hardware control are required. You benefit from exclusive access to all server resources, making it ideal for large gameservers, databases, virtualization environments, or critical infrastructure.
