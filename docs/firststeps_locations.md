More locations, faster connections and more enjoyment with the server. This is the goal of ZAP-Hosting, which was founded in 2010 in Germany where it also offered its first server location. More locations have been added steadily since then to provide the best possible experience for all of our customers. 

Due to the great international interest and growth of the company, additional locations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australia have been added over the years. We are currently offering our server products in **FFM / Eygelshoven, DE, London, UK, Helsinki, Finland, Los Angeles, USA (west), Dallas, USA (central), Ashburn, USA (east), Montreal, Canada, Sydney, Australia, Singapore, Asia**. 

We have and will continue to take feedback from our customers into consideration and check to what extent demand exists in certain locations and which products are wanted in order to be able to offer our available products in the best possible way there as well. 



## Availability of locations

As briefly mentioned in advance, we are continuously developing and expanding the scope of our products. However, this is not necessarily always easy and uncomplicated to implement. For that reason, it can happen that we are not able to offer every product at every location from the beginning. You will find an overview of the availability of the server products at the respective locations below.

## Connection quality to the locations

You are unsure which location is the best for you? That's no problem! We have developed a ping check for our server products, which allows you to test the connection from you to the locations. This way you will get an overview of all ping results at a glance and you can choose the best location for you. 

You will find the ping check option during the order process at the location selection. Click there on the **Ping-Check ðŸš€** button. The result of the respective location will then be displayed to you.
