## What is the FiveM Profiler? 

The Profiler is there to measure the performance of the server, so bad and slow resources can be identified and removed/optimized. 

This profiler is integrated in FiveM and can be used with any server.

## Usage


### RCon

First you should log on to the server via [Icecon](https://github.com/icedream/icecon/releases), the password can be found in the server settings

After we are logged in, we can now start the Profiler with the following command:

```
profiler record 25
```

Then we should wait for about 10 seconds and check whether the profiler is still running:

```
profiler status
```

If it says "Recording: No", then the recording is finished and we can now look at the recorded data above the command:

```
profiler view
```

We can now open this URL in Chrome or Firefox.


### Identifying Problems


Now we are in the Profiler and can see the performance information, it looks more complicated at the beginning than it is.

We now select a "tick" that consumes a lot of performance:

Now we can see which resources are consuming a lot of time.


:::info
Resources that consume more than 6 ms in total can cause problems.
