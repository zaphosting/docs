## Introduction

Our Voiceservers now come with the ability to quickly setup subdomains to easily access your server. In this guide, you will explore how to use the DNS Subdomain functionality for your voiceserver to generate a ZAP Cloud subdomain or setup your own domain for use.

## Availability

The Subdomain feature is available to both new and existing customers which provides you with a `xxx`**.zap.cloud** subdomain to make connecting easier. New Customers will have a subdomain automatically setup during the installation process. Existing customers will already have one generated.

## Managing Subdomains (DNS)

Managing the subdomain feature on your voiceserver is simple. Head over to the **Settings->TSDNS** section to begin.

On this page, you will be able to perform a variety of management tasks related to the Free ZAP Cloud subdomain as well as the usage of your own domains that you have setup on your ZAP-Hosting account.

:::info
Currently, you can have a maximum of 3 subdomains active per product (not including the randomly generated ZAP Cloud subdomain).
:::

### Random ZAP Cloud Subdomain

All voiceservers will have a random subdomain that they can use by default. Both new and existing customers will see a random `xxx`**.zap.cloud** subdomain on their dashboard.

If you do not see a subdomain or are facing issues, you can [contact our Support Team](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/support/) to have the random ZAP Cloud subdomain refreshed.

### Custom ZAP Cloud Subdomain

You have the ability to create your very own ZAP Cloud subdomain to suit your needs, by simply inputting the subdomain you wish to use and selecting **.zap.cloud** from the drop down menu (default option).

:::note
If you recieve an error, it is possible that the subdomain is already in use and/or you have entered a banned word or character which is not allowed to protect our customers.
:::

Now use the **Create entry** button and you should be able to see the subdomain appear in the list. You may have to wait up to a few minutes before it becomes fully functional.

### Own Domain

:::info
In order to be able to use your domain to create a subdomain, please ensure that it is associated to your ZAP-Hosting account by [purchasing it on our website](https://zap-hosting.com/en/shop/product/domain/), or transferring the domain to your account from another provider.
:::

Creating a subdomain with your own domain follows the same steps as the Custom ZAP Cloud subdomain. Input the subdomain you wish to use and select your own domain from the drop down menu.

:::note
If you recieve an error, it is possible that the subdomain is already in use and/or you have entered a banned word or character which is not allowed to protect our customers.
:::

Now use the **Create entry** button and you should be able to see the subdomain appear in the list. You may have to wait up to a few minutes before it becomes fully functional.

## Troubleshooting

### ZAP Cloud Subdomain

When creating a custom ZAP Cloud subdomain, you may recieve an error if the subdomain is already in use and/or you have entered a banned word or character which is not allowed to protect our customers.

If you are experiencing any other issues with the ZAP Cloud subdomains, please contact our Support Team by [creating a ticket on our website](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/support/).

### Custom Domain

If you cannot see your own domain in the drop down menu when attempting to create a subdomain, this is likely as you do not have it associated with your ZAP-Hosting account.

Please ensure that the domain is active on your ZAP-Hosting account, which may involve transferring it from other providers.

If you are still facing issues regarding any part of the subdomain feature, please contact our Support Team by [creating a ticket on our website](https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/support/) and we will be happy to help out.
