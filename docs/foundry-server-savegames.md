In this guide, we will explore how to manage your Foundry Gamesaves on your game server, including backing up your local and server savegames as well as uploading it to your server.

## Prerequisites

In order to access your server files, you will require an FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) which are both open-source and free to download.

You will have to connect to your server through an FTP Client using the credentials that are found under **Tools->FTP-Broswer** on your game server's webinterface. Please use our [FTP File Access guide](gameserver-ftpaccess.md) as further assistance to connect to your server.


## Backup Savegame

### Local Savegame

Local Savegames are ones which you have created whilst hosting a multiplayer game locally on your device. These can be found within your Widnows LocalLow AppData, specifically in the following path:
```
../AppData/LocalLow/Channel 3 Entertainment/Foundry/save
```

:::tip
You can easily access this directly path by pressing `CTRL` + `R` at the same time and searching for the following path in the run dialog: `%userprofile%/appdata/locallow/Channel 3 Entertainment/foundry/save`. Simply press **OK** and you will be taken to the folder.

:::

At this location, you will be able to see a folder which will be your SteamID. Open this folder and you will be able to see all of your local Savegames in one place.

### Accessing Savegame via FTP

Backing up your Savegame from the server is simple. Once you have connected to your game server through an FTP Client, head over to the following path:
```
../foundry/saves/save
```

At this location, you should be able to see folders which are each a Savegame. Simply right-click on the folder and use the **Download** button to save it locally to your device.

### Automatic Backup

We also provide an option to automatically backup your Savegame (and configuration file) directly through our webinterface. Simply head over to your game server's webinterface and go to the **Tools->Backups** section. Here you can configure a variety of options to schedule automatic backups for your server. We provide you with 10gb free backup storage which your backups will be stored in. For further information regarding backups, have a look at our dedicated [Automatic Server Backup guide](gameserver-backups.md) for this topic.

## Uploading Savegame

Similarly to backing up, uploading your Savegame is simple. First ensure that you connect to your game server through an FTP Client. Once you are ready, head over to the following path:
```
../foundry/saves/save
```

Simply drag and drop any of your Savegames into this folder through your FTP Client and it will be uploaded to your server.

:::tip
It may be useful to copy the name of the Gamesave folder that you have uploaded, as you will need this if you wish to activate it in the next section.

## Activating Savegame

In order to use a specific Savegame, you will have to edit a configuration file. There are a few methods of doing this, we will cover doing this through the webinterface since this is the most user-friendly. If you wish to see other methods of editing the file, please see our [Foundry Configuration guide](foundry-configuration.md) which covers this.

Simply head over to the **Settings** section on your game server's webinterface and find the **Savename** setting.

Change this setting to the name of the savegame folder that you uploaded in the previous step. Once ready, ensure that you save at the bottom using the green **Save** button and then restart your server.
