It therefore also happens that player 1 sees server Y, but player 2 does not. Player 3, on the other hand, sees it again, but does not see another server that player 1 sees. To rule out a problem with the server provider, you can search for the server under &quot;Steam&quot; - &quot;View&quot; - &quot;Server&quot; with IP and port. If it is found there, the connection between player and server is faultless. This is because a direct query is made by the player. A good example to validate the problem is that ARK players in particular who have opened the game via Steam cannot find servers. If they open ARK in Epic Games, the servers are found perfectly. No Steamworks is used here. There are also various game developers who have commented on this problem. For example, Garry Newman from Garrysmod thought that the problem was related to his server provider OVH. However, this was not the case. The problem is also with ZAP hosting and every other server provider, as it is directly with Steamworks: Source: https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1334446218437681152?s=20 Or even Rust, as they write in their blog: It's not all roses and rainbows when you have such a sudden boost in popularity. You start seeing cracks forming in the foundations, most noticeable for us the server browser was never intended to handle such a large amount of servers. Without going into the technicality this has resulted in many servers not displaying for users and causing a lot of frustration for server owners. We're currently working on and exploring solutions so please bear with us.

For this purpose the function LevelExperienceRampOverrides is used. It was implemented with the v194 version. More detailed information and examples about this can be found in the Steam forum: Extended Game Options: How to Configure your Custom ARK server. The command is applied twice. The first is for the player level and the second is for the dinosaur level. The syntax for this looks like this: [/script/shootergame.shootergamemode] LevelExperienceRampOverrides=( ExperiencePointsForLevel[&lt;LEVELVALUE&gt;]=&lt;Points&gt;, ExperiencePointsForLevel[&lt;LEVELVALUE&gt;]=&lt;Points&gt;, ExperiencePointsForLevel[&lt;LEVELVALUE&gt;]=&lt;Points&gt;)  The square brackets define the respective levels (LEVELVALUE) and behind the equal sign the amount of XP (Points) needed to reach the respective level is defined. So, for example, if you want to have 500 levels as the level limit, then this would look like this: [/script/shootergame.shootergamemode] LevelExperienceRampOverrides=( ExperiencePointsForLevel[0]=100, ExperiencePointsForLevel[1]=200, ExperiencePointsForLevel[2]=300, ExperiencePointsForLevel[3]=400, ExperiencePointsForLevel[4]=500, ExperiencePointsForLevel[5]=600, ... // Shortened for illustrative purposes ExperiencePointsForLevel[499]=50000)  "},{"title":"Engram points​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Server configuration","url":"/guides/docs/ark_configuration#engram-points","content":"With each level-up you get Engram points.

Adding an admin is done via the Clientpermissions.xml Config, which you can find in the interface under Configs.  A new client entry must be added to the Config to add a new player. The syntax for this looks like this: &lt;Client name=&quot;&lt;player name&gt;&quot; steamid=&quot;&lt;steamid&gt;&quot; permissions=&quot;&lt;permission(s)&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;command name=&quot;&lt;commandname&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Client&gt;  The client entry contains the variables Name, SteamID, Permissions, and Command. Those must be modified. The name can be set as desired. It only serves as a placeholder for an overview. Afterwards the SteamID64 of your Steam Account must be defined. You can find it by accessing your Steam profile and then right-clicking anywhere on the profile. There you can copy the Steam URL of the profile.

You can add them by adding the permissions and commands that can be used.

Unfortunately, these measures often lead to problems, which many already know about. Some of these tools do not just significantly slow down the performance of the code, but also introduce numerous security concerns. FiveM has therefore started blocking malicious resources that contain malicious code designed to infect servers and other resources. These resources sometimes try to &quot;spread&quot; their code to other resources to give third parties access to scripts and databases.

By using our gameserver cloud, you can install and switch between Minecraft modpacks for free. Minecraft modpacks have the same slot price.

In order to get the most accurate values possible, which refer to a possible problem on the server, the problematic period should first be narrowed down by the sliders below, as shown in the graph:  "},{"title":"Investigate server values​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Identify server problems with timings report","url":"/guides/docs/minecraft_timings_report#investigate-server-values","content":"There are 3 columns in total. As you can see on the screenshot below, box number 1 shows how much % of a tick ( 20 ticks is one second) the main process needs. Among other things, you can also see how often this process was executed during the recording. In Box number 2 you can see more precise values in miliseconds, but please note that the time should never be higher than 50ms. If this is the case, it would cause a chain reaction and all further processes would accumulate a bit, which would eventually lead to laggs as the server can only handle the processes with delay. The Full Server Tick can usually be ignored, since the values are always in the red area, but this is not a big issue.  In any case you should always investigate the colored highlighted values points more closely. In this example, we have a look at the process for all entities (animals, monsters, items, etc.), as the values are already displayed as orange. From this you might be able to directly conclude that there is a problem with too many entities on the server. Possibly there are mob farms on the server, or masses of new mobs are being spawned. If you have problems with too many entities, you can throttle the spawn rate in the settings or install plugins that limit the number of entities and remove them automatically if necessary. As described above, the list basically always shows the main process. By clicking on a process, we can take a closer look at individual processes for each type of entity and investigate them. Please also pay attention to columns 2 and 3 as mentioned earlier. You will notice that Minecraft::tickEntity - nms.EntitySkeleton has executed a lot of processes. Again, mob farms may be the problem.  Another process with already orange values are waiting blocks. Blocks that wait can be particularly inefficient because the server has to check the status of each waiting block every tick.As an example, this would be flying sand, gravel or even lava and water. If a lot of water is used as an example on a large farm, this can cause many problems, among other things. The problem can also arise if new chunks are generated and water sources are created in these chunks in a mountain. The server has to calculate the status each time again so that the water flows smoothly. In addition, the server must create and load the chunks, which is also a very intense process.  All further investigations can also be carried out in the same way, since the steps are exactly the same for any other process. If you still need help with the evaluation, we are always available for you!

To determine that a plugin is possibly the cause, you can temporarily remove installed plugins from the server and check the current state of the system again. If an issue with plugins exists, this can also be investigated in the &quot;Plugins&quot; section. The values are also listed in three columns, which have exactly the same structure as the normal server values above. The difference is that there is no longer a main process shown. Instead, the plugin itself is shown. However, we can still check all processes by clicking on them and investigate the values more closely.

This documentation is therefore not necessarily to be followed exactly, but rather intended as a help in going in the right direction. In most cases, optimization changes a great number of settings on the servers, which in some cases significantly changes the behavior of the server itself.

With a vanilla server, the visibility range can be adjusted in the &quot;server.properties&quot; config, for this the value &quot;view-disance&quot; must be adjusted. In order not to restrict the gaming experience too much, it is recommended to set this value to 5-6, which relieves the server by up to 50%.

The server then only has to load the saved chunk data during later operation with players and not create and generate the entire chunks. This process can best be left to run overnight, which you start in the evening beforehand. An additional mod must be installed for this. A very suitable mod can be installed here. The mod can then be installed normally on the server as described in our instructions. Before the server is restarted, you should ensure that the &quot;max-tick-time&quot; in the &quot;server.properties&quot; is set to &quot;-1&quot;. Otherwise, the server could crash. It is also advisable that min. 8-10 GB of RAM are available, as this process unfortunately requires a lot of RAM. For this purpose, the RAM can be briefly upgraded overnight, which can then be downgraded again after this process has been completed. Note that the mod mentioned above may not be compatible with the version of Forge you are using and the process may differ from the one described here if you are using a different mod. As soon as the server is started with the mod, the console must be opened. We would recommend creating a border for the world with a radius of 16,000 blocks. To do this, the following commands must be executed in sequence: worldborder center 0 0worldborder set 16000 If necessary, replace the coordinates to your own center of the world with the center command so as not to &quot;cut off&quot; your world (which may already have been built). As soon as the border has been set, the actual pre-loading can be started. To do this, the following command must be executed: pregen gen startWorldBorder Now all chunks within the border are preloaded one after the other. This process can take up to 8 hours depending on the number of mods installed. The progress of this process is always outputed in the console through info messages at regular intervals. As soon as the process is finished, this is also outputed in the console! The mod can still be installed on the server even after this process is complete.

The standard view range is 10 chunks, but many players play with far fewer, such as 6-8. Some players overdo it with the chunks and sometimes set this to 32 chunks as an example, which means that the server then has to load and process all of these chunks, which costs a lot of performance. With a (paper) spigot server, the view range can be adjusted in the &quot;spigot.yml&quot; config, for this the value &quot;view-disance&quot; must be adjusted. In order not to restrict the gaming experience too much, it is recommended to set this value to 5-6, which relieves the server by up to 50%. Depending on your preference, the value can also be set to 4, which as an example helps very well against lagging when you operate farm world servers that are operated on version 1.13+ "},{"title":"Data-Compression​","type":1,"pageTitle":"server performance optimisation","url":"/guides/docs/minecraft_server_optimize#data-compression-4","content":"On a server there is a permanent exchange between the server and the connected players. The movements of the players themselves are transmitted to the server and the server then sends this in turn to all other players. But also player actions or events in the world, such as explosions as an example, are part of the data that is transmitted over and over again. In order to make the regularity of this exchange a little more elegant, the size of the packed data can be doubled, which means that the server only has to do 50% of the effort to exchange the same data with the players compared to before. To do this, the value &quot;network-compression-threshold&quot; must also be adjusted in the &quot;server.properties&quot; config. The value should be set to 512 here. Here, too, we already have an entry in our documentation, which can be here. "},{"title":"Spawn-Limits​","type":1,"pageTitle":"server performance optimisation","url":"/guides/docs/minecraft_server_optimize#spawn-limits-2","content":"In this step, the general spawn rates of mobs on the server are reduced somewhat. There is almost no noticeable difference compared to the normal values. Nevertheless, it can happen in some places with mob farms as an example that the mob farm does not work as planned. In order to adjust the settings for this, the config &quot;bukkit.yml&quot; must be edited. The following values must then be adjusted at the point &quot;spawn-limits&quot;: monsters: 50 #Default: 70animals: 10 #Default: 15water-animals: 3 #Default: 5ambient: 4 #Default: 15 You are of course still welcome to adjust the values yourself if you wish, otherwise the above values are a very good average. To further improve the spawning, the &quot;monster-spawns&quot; value in the &quot;tickes-per&quot; item should also be changed in the &quot;bukkit.yml&quot; config: monster-spawns: 2 #Default: 1 If there is a general problem with monsters as an example (as can be determined as an example in the timing report), the value can be set up to 5. The behavior of the server should then be looked at with each value in order to find the best value for your own server. "},{"title":"Chunk-Processing​","type":1,"pageTitle":"server performance optimisation","url":"/guides/docs/minecraft_server_optimize#chunk-processing-2","content":"Minecraft works with so-called chunks. A chunk is always formed from 16x16 blocks, which are then strung together and visually represents the world for the client. The server therefore only works with chunks and then loads the required chunks into the RAM. The more chunks are loaded and permanently processed by the server, the more power the server has to provide for this, which in some places brings the server to its knees. Servers with the standard settings will never unload loaded chunks, which means that the RAM is used very heavily in places and an enormous amount of it is required. Of course, the performance of the server is unfortunately very much reduced here, as more and more has to be processed. To ensure that the server only loads the chunks that are currently needed, the following options in the &quot;bukkit.yml&quot; config under &quot;chunk-gc&quot; must be adjusted: period-in-ticks: 300 #Default: 600load-threshold: 300 #Default: 0 The &quot;period-in-ticks&quot; option determines at what intervals in seconds the chunks should be unloaded. If desired, this value can also be reduced further, but you should note that an undesirable effect may then occur: a loop In the case of a loop, the chunk would be unloaded, whereupon the chunk is only needed a few later, which means that the server then has to invest performance and time again to reload this chunk. This would then repeat itself over and over again, which puts a greater load on the server than if the chunks remained loaded for a minute longer as an example. "},{"title":"Spawn-Range​","type":1,"pageTitle":"server performance optimisation","url":"/guides/docs/minecraft_server_optimize#spawn-range-1","content":"Mobs can always spawn from players at certain intervals. Here we are turning this rate down a bit so that there are no problems with mob spawning. This setting is very important, as some of the settings for spawning have already been adjusted, which were explained above.

Spawners then create more and more mobs on the server, which can lead to a lot of problems. This option adjusts the spawn behavior of the spawner somewhat so that the server activates the spawner at short intervals. To do this, the following value in &quot;paper.yml&quot; must be adjusted: mob-spawner-tick-rate: 3 #Default: 1 The value used above doesn't change behavior too much and doesn't really affect gaming behavior. "},{"title":"Entity-Ranges​","type":1,"pageTitle":"server performance optimisation","url":"/guides/docs/minecraft_server_optimize#entity-ranges-1","content":"At this point, we now set when entities - i.e. animals and monsters - are activated. This means that the animals can move as an example or monsters can also recognize players. Basically this is activated for all mobs, but in a kind of standby. In standby mode, the mobs can continue to move and also recognize players, but as an example, the mobs can only move very slowly, which means that the server does not have to provide much power. Here, too, the changes must be made in the &quot;spigot.yml&quot; config under the item &quot;entity-activation-range&quot;.

But for servers these are real poison! For each set funnel, the server has to check 20 times every second whether an item is ready to be picked up. Moving the items from funnel to funnel or in a box also costs valuable work! In order to improve the whole thing a bit, we increase the time intervals at which the server should carry out such actions. With the values ​​used here, such an action is carried out and checked every 3 seconds. The transfer rates do not change here. However, it can happen that redstone clocks that were created with hoppers may no longer work correctly. To adjust the settings, the following values must be adjusted in the &quot;spigot.yml&quot; config: hopper-transfer: 24 #Default: 8hopper-check: 24 #Default: 8hopper-amount: 3 #Default: 1 Make sure that the value &quot;use-hopper-check&quot; is set to &quot;true&quot; in the &quot;paper.yml&quot; config!

To adapt the setting, the following value must be adapted in &quot;spigot.yml&quot;: max-entity-collisions: 1 #Default: 8 Since collisions have no real effect on mobs, the setting can be turned down here.

"},{"title":"Merge-Radius​","type":1,"pageTitle":"server performance optimisation","url":"/guides/docs/minecraft_server_optimize#merge-radius-1","content":"The merge radius determines which items and XP are merged, which means that the server has to process fewer entities.

For this, the following value must be edited in the &quot;paper.yml&quot; config: container-update-tick-rate: 3 #Default: 1 The value should not be set higher than 5, otherwise the inventory may be a bit buggy!

"},{"title":"Partnered, what now?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Partner Guide The Partner Program of ZAP-Hosting","url":"/guides/docs/partner-guide#partnered-what-now","content":"In the first discussions with your partner manager we will clarify what your current needs are and which products we will provide you with free of charge so that you can adequately advertise for us. Of course, we make sure that there is a healthy balance between your reach and the value of the products we provide. Although we provide them free of charge, they still have to be maintained by our technicians and the hardware has to be kept in good condition. Once we have clarified this need and covered it accordingly, we discuss individually with each Influencer how the future cooperation should be arranged. In general, we would like to have motivated partners who develop and implement ideas independently, but there are a few basics we would like to have from each partner as a basis for our cooperation. Among these basics we count the following points: Visual branding with ZAP-Hosting logos in streams, panels and headersSetting up Timed Bot Messages, which post advertising links in the chat during the livestreamsInteraction with our social media contentParticipation in giveaways or implementation of own giveaways with ZAP products Since we know how well thought out some of our influencer channel brandings are, we don't want to give you guidelines and impose ready-made graphics. We prefer to provide you with our logo and leave the design to you. But what we would like to see here is a prominent placement of the panel under your stream and in your overlay. Here are a few examples of how you could create bot timers, video descriptions and shoutouts: Your own server is waiting!

Our partners are divided into the ranks Silver, Gold and Diamond. These ranks differ not only in their names, but also in the services we provide and of course the services of the respective influencer/partner. At first each partner starts in the Silver Rank and receives a basic equipment with free servers, graphics and a contact person for questions (Partner Manager). After a few weeks or months, if we recognize that the partner is particularly active, implements creative ideas and his community is particularly enthusiastic about us, we invite him to a Discord talk and discuss future visions together. During such discussions, we will clarify, among other things, whether there is a desire to negotiate a fixed monthly remuneration in case of continued performance. As soon as partners have reached the final rank of Diamond Partner, other benefits such as hardware equipment, individual hardware sets and bonus programs will be offered in addition to monthly financial compensation.

Partner links are only for tracking your services and the clicks of your target group. We use the activity through your links to get an impression of how active our influencers are in promoting us and how many customers found us through them. These values are always relevant when it comes to talks about upgrading to the next partner rank or introducing a fixed monthly payment. So partner links primarily generate data and not money for you. In contrast to this are the links that were created via the generator in the category Advertise friends. Sales generated through these links track the link's sales and allow a percentage revenue share. These turnovers are summed up over time and can be paid out to us via a written invoice. However, some of our partners will provide products worth several hundred euros free of charge, * we will prohibit all partners from using &quot;refer a friend&quot; links for the time being, unless otherwise agreed!

We appreciate active actions of our partners very much and wish and above all partners who creatively maintain the partnership on their own initiative. Partners who stick our logo into their description and enjoy inactive free servers will not be part of our repertoire in the long run. Inspire your followers, members, friends or viewers and simply provide them with your links. They won't pay a cent more and still support you immensely!

However, if we see, based on the statistics, that partners have become inactive, have not kept our agreements or have otherwise acted against our agreements, we reserve the right to dissolve the existing partnership and to stop the free supply of products. Of course, in such cases we will give sufficient time to secure the data and structure this change. Should you be inactive for a longer period of time for health or other important reasons, please inform your Partner Manager so that he can take this into account. Unfortunately, we will no longer show any understanding for this, however, because of repeated delays in the implementation of agreements, violation of discussed behaviours, creating a negative image that could influence the image of ZAP hosting, unsolicited advertising of a competitor with the same topic and unannounced inactivity over a long period of time. In these cases we will contact you personally, discuss the situation and eventually end our sponsorship with immediate effect**. If you intend to leave the sponsoring program of ZAP, please contact your partner manager. He will guide you through the steps and give you the opportunity to download all relevant data of your products.

"},{"title":"Server listing problems with Steam games using Steamworks","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/guides/docs/valheim_serverlisting","content":"Server listing problems with Steam games using Steamworks Unfortunately, many popular games like ARK or Valheim have massive problems with listing all servers in the ingame server list. This is because these games use the &quot;Steamworks&quot; software for their listing. Steamworks can list a maximum of 4880 servers. If a game has more than this number of active servers, only a small part of the active servers will be listed for the player. It is very random whether player 1 sees server Y or not. It therefore also happens that player 1 sees server Y, but player 2 does not. Player 3, on the other hand, sees it again, but does not see another server that player 1 sees. To rule out a problem with the server provider, you can search for the server under &quot;Steam&quot; - &quot;View&quot; - &quot;Server&quot; with IP and port. If it is found there, the connection between player and server is faultless. This is because a direct query is made by the player. A good example to validate the problem is that ARK players in particular who have opened the game via Steam cannot find servers. If they open ARK in Epic Games, the servers are found perfectly. No Steamworks is used here. There are also various game developers who have commented on this problem. For example, Garry Newman from Garrysmod thought that the problem was related to his server provider OVH. However, this was not the case. The problem is also with ZAP hosting and every other server provider, as it is directly with Steamworks: Source: https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1334446218437681152?s=20 Or even Rust, as they write in their blog: It's not all roses and rainbows when you have such a sudden boost in popularity. You start seeing cracks forming in the foundations, most noticeable for us the server browser was never intended to handle such a large amount of servers. Without going into the technicality this has resulted in many servers not displaying for users and causing a lot of frustration for server owners. We're currently working on and exploring solutions so please bear with us. Source: https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/ We will continue to keep an eye on the problem and inform here when there is a solution.","keywords":""},{"title":"Managing savegames on servers","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/guides/docs/valheim_savegame","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Download Savegames​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Managing savegames on servers","url":"/guides/docs/valheim_savegame#download-savegames","content":"Note: Before downloading the savegame you have to stop the server, to save the active savegame, after stopping the server the savegame will show up after reloading the page once.

If you wanted to have a large web presence, a root server would often also be the best choice for this as well. If you are still not sure what is the better choice for you, you are welcome to contact our support. Let us know what exactly you want to do with the server and we will gladly advise you of what we think is best!

If a domain is created in the web space, it is always unencrypted at the beginning. This can be seen in the Plesk panel:  And the notification in the browser when opening the domain:  With an SSL certificate, a domain can be protected/encrypted accordingly. "},{"title":"Creation of the Certificate​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Create SSL certificate","url":"/guides/docs/webspace_plesk_ssl#creation-of-the-certificate","content":"Step 1️⃣: With a double click on &quot;SSL/TLS Certificate&quot; the following menu opens:  A Lets Encrypt Certificate can be requested free of charge. Step 2️⃣: Enter/fill in the required information. In order for the certificate to be requested, details must be provided. A mail address must be specified and a check must be made of what the certificate should be valid for. As a rule, each domain also has the subdomain &quot;www&quot; active, which is why it is also selected if it has also been entered in the DNS of the domain.  The certificate is then requested by clicking on &quot;Get it free&quot;. Step 3️⃣: The certificate has now been created, this can be seen at the top right. In addition, the automatic forwarding from HTTP to HTTPS must now take place, since otherwise encryption cannot be established:  If this has been done, the forwarding is now active. No matter whether you open the page with http or https directly in the browser, it is now always directed to https. Step 4️⃣: Now you can check in the browser whether the certificate has been recognized: The lock must be present:  The certificate info, which can be opened by clicking on the lock, should also show the domain:  The website is now properly protected/encrypted. "},{"title":"Certificates for Subdomains​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Create SSL certificate","url":"/guides/docs/webspace_plesk_ssl#certificates-for-subdomains","content":"The same steps can theoretically also be followed for a subdomain. However, there is also an easier way to encrypt all subdomains at the same time, regardless of whether they already exist or which are new. A &quot;wildcard certificate&quot; can be used for this. This requires a special TXT entry in the DNS of the domain. As soon as it is available, however, it can issue an SSL certificate for all subdomains. Step 1️⃣: The SSL/TLS certificate menu is opened again.  Then click on &quot;Renew Certificate&quot; in the top left. Now the Lets Encrypt request window opens:  Now select &quot;Secure the wildcard domainn&quot;:  The subdomain &quot;www&quot; and &quot;webmail&quot; are automatically added. The button &quot;Get it free&quot; is then clicked again. Step 2️⃣: A blue box now appears with important information:  A domain name and a value are given there. This must be permanently available as a TXT in the DNS of the domain, this is the only way Lets Encrypt can ensure that the domain is genuine and can be verified. An entry in the DNS should look like this:  A DNS entry can take up to 24 hours to be accessible from anywhere in the world. To ensure that the TXT entry is already active, the &quot;TXT Lookup SuperTool&quot; from mxtoolbox can be used: https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx:  If the entered entry is already displayed, it can be confirmed in the blue box in Plesk by clicking on &quot;Reload&quot;. Now it is checked whether the DNS entry is present, since this is the case, after a few seconds &quot;protected&quot; is displayed for &quot;SSL/TLS-holder Ccertificate&quot; aka &quot;Wildcard Certificate&quot;:  If a subdomain is now created, it is already protected:  Now the complete data transfer is encrypted to the side, done.

This includes getting the software, setting up the database to be used and the mail server (email address). Software The software can be downloaded from the official website of WordPress. The download for it can be found here: WordPress Download  The download contains a packed zip file, which must be unpacked on your local computer. Inside you will find a folder with the name wordpress. It's content is needed and must be uploaded either via FTP or File Manager. In this example the setup is shown using FTP. You can create an FTP user under Websites &amp; Domains at FTP-Access.  Now we connect to the web space with the created FTP account. There we navigate to the httpdocs directory and upload the files of the software.  Database As next, the database must be created, which will later be used to store all information of the website. To do this, click again on Websites &amp; Domains and then on Databases. Then click on Add Database and create a database:  Click on OK and the database will be created.
