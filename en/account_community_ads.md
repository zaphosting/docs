## 📃 Community Advertising

Community advertising is a way to earn money by advertising ZAP hosting. By using this feature it's also possible to get "**free**" servers. Good advertising which is submitted and also accepted would be compensated with "**0.24€**" for each link.

## ❓ What has to be considered when advertising?

### The advertisement needs to be independently 

We therefore only confirm and accept advertising where we can clearly see that it was written by the customer himself.
It's sufficient to use the same username as the one used at ZAP-Hosting when creating the advertisement.

### Comments are not considered as advertising

If a person asks the question, "Which hosters can you recommend?"
Then a comment would be something like, "ZAP is cool!" or "I would recommend ZAP hosting."But good advertising would be more extensive and informative. That might look like this: "I would recommend ZAP-Hosting, they have a ..., you can ..., they offer ..., 
If you don't know them yet, you could also see all products and prices here: https://zap-hosting.com/en".

### Advertising must be customer-oriented

An advertisement has to be placed in areas that could be interesting for ZAP hosting. The aim of the advertisement is to draw people's attention to ZAP-Hosting and to win them as new customers. This is therefore more likely to happen in a forum about servers and server providers than in a forum about agriculture.
