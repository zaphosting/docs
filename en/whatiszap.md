All entries also have a right sidebar, with which you can quickly find certain parts of the entry:

If you find a mistake, want to correct an image, or even write your own entry, you can do so through our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zap-docs/docs).

## Structure & Tools

It is important that instructions are written in a consistent style. This includes proper spelling as well as the use of formatting (code blocks, screenshots, indentations, fonts, etc.) and emojis.


### 📚 Table of contents

On the right hand side next to Instructions you will find a table of contents which you can use to quickly jump to the desired location.
This includes h2 and h3 tags that are used in this way:

h2 Tag:
``` 
## Text 
```
h3 Tag:
```
### Text
```

For understanding once again:
```
(h1) # Not displayed in the list
(h2) ## Displayed
(h3) ### Is displayed as a sub-entry below the upper one
(h4) #### Not displayed in the list
```

### 😀 Emojis

In the tables of contents emojis should be used for all h3 tags.
Download an Emoji Picker for Firefox. Example:

## Creating a new page

### 🗃️ Repository klonen

To create a new page, the repository must be forked:

![](https://i.imgur.com/IfVrnoY.png)

This fork is a 1:1 copy of the repository on your own account, where changes can be made.

> If your fork already exists but is no longer up to date, it must be recreated, this is done in [the following video](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/JyXci8T6ziCk424/)

![](https://i.imgur.com/lIyCWc2.png)

### 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Language selection

To create a new file, first open the folder of the language you want to create the page for (in our example it is **en**).

![](https://i.imgur.com/EBXMRts.png)

Here all data of the Docs are stored, to create a new one, click on "Create new file"

![](https://i.imgur.com/SaPdUqx.png)

### 📁 Filename

Give the file a name, pay attention to the categorization, if it is a wiki entry for Minecraft, the file should start with "minecraft_", e.g.

```
minecraft_configure
```

Also, the file extension must always be 'md', the end result will look like this:

```
minecraft_configure.md
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/BaxQ8ZA.png)

Now the metadata of the page must be created, use the following example:

```
---
id: pagename
title: Page-Title
sidebar_label: Page-Title
---
```

In our example the file would look like this:

```
---
id: minecraft_configure
title: Server Properties
sidebar_label: Server Properties
---
```

### 📡 Second Language

After the page has been written, it must now be recreated in the "en" folder and translated.

> Note: pages must **always** have an English and German version.

### 📚 Navigation

Once both versions have been created, all you need to do is add your new page to sidebar.json:

![](https://i.imgur.com/YyutX8M.png)

> The sidebars.json file describes where exactly in the left sidebar the articles are located and follows the JSON format.

To add the page to Minecraft, you need to find the Minecraft category and decide which category it fits into:

![](https://i.imgur.com/C5XPt7b.png)

If you are not sure if an existing subcategory fits, a new one can be created using the following example:

```json
{
 "type":"subcategory",
 "label":"Name of subcategory",
 "ids":[
	"ids",
    "the",
    "pages"
 ]
},
```

In our example this would be as follows:

```json
{
    "type":"subcategory",
    "label":"Administration",
    "ids":[
        "minecraft_configure"
    ]
},
```


If you already have a suitable category, you can simply add it again:

For subcategories:
```json
{
    "type":"subcategory",
    "label":"Administration",
    "ids":[
        "minecraft_addop",
        "minecraft_worlds",
        "minecraft_configure"
    ]
},
```

For normal categories:
```json
"Minecraft":[
    "minecraft_configure"
]
```
### 🥅 Finalization
