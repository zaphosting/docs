## Connect with FTP

First, the [FTP-Access](gameserver_ftpaccess.md) must be set up:

After this has been set up, you can now connect and open the server folder:

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/QoXf3iSZirN7Ndy/preview)

Here we open the following path: `gta5-fivem/server-data/resources/vrp/cfg/money.lua`

## Upload Money Icon

To use your own money icon, you first have to upload it to Imgur (or your desired uploader):

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/5sA37RxfLQqQFjA/preview)

Here we can now upload our picture via drag & drop:

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/Y5Q57pW5znbEPMP/preview)

After the upload we see our picture uploaded to copy the URL, we right click on the icon and choose "Copy Image Address"

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/xRqX73NHiA59JXZ/preview)

This URL can now be entered in the config.

## Edit Config

In the money.lua some settings of the money display can be adjusted. To change the money icon, we can edit the following line:

`content: url('https://i.imgur.com/JUz1njC.png'); `

We just replace this URL with our own Imgur link and save the file.

After a server restart, the Icon Ingame will be visible.
