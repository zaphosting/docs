## Connect to FTP

In order to be able to set up your Bot, the [FTP access](gameserver_ftpaccess.md) needs to be configured.

## Preparation

Once we are connected using FTP, we have to open our `discordbot` folder, this is where we upload our bot files:

## Upload your Bot

We can now simply upload our bot files into the empty folder:

## Configuring the Dashboard

To be able to run your bot using the Dashboard, the bot needs to be configured using the "Settings" Page:

Here we now have to configure which programming language the Bot uses, and how it's main file is called:

in our case this is python 3 and main.py respectively.

## Starting the Bot

After saving the Settings, the bot can simply be started using the green start button at the top of the page!

In the Live-Console you can then check if the bot has successfully started!
