Unfortunately, there is currently a bug in the Valheim server software, which is why each server needs its own IP. This can be booked via the upgrade or downgrade menu as follows:

After the own Ipv4 address is booked, the server must be restarted once, then the server will appear after about 10 minutes in the server list.


Alternatively you can contact the support, unfortunately a solution of this problem is not guaranteed there, since an own IP is necessary for it.
