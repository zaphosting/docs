## What is the FiveM Profiler? 

The Profiler is there to measure the performance of the server, so bad and slow resources can be identified and removed/optimized. 

This profiler is integrated in FiveM and can be used with any server.

## Usage


### 🔑 RCon

First you should log on to the server via IceCon, the password can be found in the server settings:

After we are logged in, we can now start the Profiler with the following command:

```
profiler record 25
```

Then we should wait for about 10 seconds and check whether the profiler is still running:

```
profiler status
```

If it says "Recording: No", then the recording is finished and we can now look at the recorded data above the command:

```
profiler view
```

We can now open this URL in Chrome or Firefox.


### ❓ Identifying Problems

Now we are in the Profiler and can see the performance information, it looks more complicated at the beginning than it is.

We now select a "tick" that consumes a lot of performance:

Now scroll in so that we can see the individual times:

Now we can see which resources are consuming a lot of time.

In our case, only "Webadmin" is a bit slow, but this does not cause any performance problems. If a resource consumes a lot of time it should be deactivated for testing and a new measurement made.



> Resources that consume more than 6 ms in total can cause problems.
