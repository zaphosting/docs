## 📔 Overview

First of all we need our data for the FTP server.
We find this under the tab **Tools**.

Here we have now our data which we only have to enter into Filezilla.

## 🔐 FTP connection

Now we can connect to our server using FTP.

Just enter here the data we have just searched for.

## 📑 Locate Cache

Now you have to find the folder and delete it.
To do this we proceed as follows:

We follow this path: **user/gta5-fivem/server-data**
Once there, we also find the *Cache* folder.

## 📖 Clear Cache

Now we just have to clear/empty the cache

To do this we click on the folder *Cache* and then on *Files*.

Now we mark all folders and delete them afterwards.

Once you have done this, the cache has been successfully cleared.
When the server is restarted, the server will rewrite the cache.
