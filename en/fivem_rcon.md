## What is Rcon?

Rcon is a protocol for executing commands on the server without having direct access to the console.

### Preparation

First of all [Icecon](https://github.com/icedream/icecon/releases) is needed, because we are working on Windows we download `icecon_windows_amd64.exe` in this case.

Now Icecon can be opened, no installation is required.

Now we can click on "Connect" above, this opens the following dialog:

With the server IP & port we simply enter the whole IP of our game server.

The password can be found in the settings of your game server.

We now enter these data into Icecon and press OK

Now we are logged into Icecon and can execute commands.
