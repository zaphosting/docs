### üñ• SSH-Connection

Linux server products do not include a graphical management interface by default, which is why the connection and management is done via an SSH client (console). There is a wide range of SSH clients available. Below is an overview of the known / often used SSH clients. 



| SSH-Client | Supported operating systems | Open-Source |                           Download                           |
| :--------: | :--------------------------: | :---------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Putty    |        Windows, Linux        |     Yes      |               [Klick](https://www.putty.org/)                |
|   Kitty    |        Windows, Linux        |     Yes      |        [Klick](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/)                   |
| MobaXterm  |        Windows, Linux        |     Yes      |           [Klick](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)            |
| SecureCRT  |     Windows, Linux, Mac      |    No     | [Klick](https://www.vandyke.com/cgi-bin/releases.php?product=securecrt) |
| mRemoteNG  |           Windows            |     Yes      |           [Klick](https://mremoteng.org/download)            |



## üèò IP address & access

In the following, the connection using the Putty SSH client is explained. In the configuration window, the IP address of the server and the SSH port 22 are entered for the **hostname**. Afterwards, the connection establishment can be started via the **Open** button.

> By default, SSH login via password is disabled. If you want to log in with the password, you have to activate the option under **Access & Security** first.

> When connecting to the server for the first time, a security message from Putty appears, informing you that no host key has been cached in the registry yet. This can be confirmed with **Yes** if you do not want to continue to receive this message every time. 

 

This opens the SSH console and prompts for a **user name** and **password**. The user name is "**root**". The password can be found in the web interface under "**Access & Security**" or can be set there.
