## Refer a Friend program
The Refer a Friend Program is our affiliate program that allows you to earn money or ZAP coins by referring new customers to ZAP hosting.

## How does it work?

On our "[Refer a Friend](https://zap-hosting.com/de/customer/affiliate/)" page you can create affiliate links and banners. These links and banners can be published and promoted on a website, a forum, your social media or streaming channels. If someone clicks on the link and buys a product on ZAP-Hosting.com, you will receive a sales commission.

## The commissions
Through the Refer a Friend program you will receive a sales commission of up to 50%. The exact sales commissions for all products can be found on the refer a friend page under "[conditions](https://zap-hosting.com/de/customer/affiliate/conditions/)".

> The commission paid is a net value.
This means that the VAT will be deducted from your displayed affiliate balance when the commission is paid out. 

## Create affiliate link

To create an affiliate link, click on the "[Refer a Friend](https://zap-hosting.com/de/customer/affiliate/)" page on "Create a new ad" and select the "Link" button. Then you can create the link by filling out the following fields and clicking "Create":

'Alias'.

> You can customize your link any way you want so that the link is readable and easy to remember. The alias is attached to "https://zap-hosting.com/". The link will look like this: 
> "https://zap-hosting.com/alias". 
> If you do not create an alias, a random alias will be created.

`Link text`

> An HTML code is created for the link, which you can easily insert into web pages. The link text is then the clickable text that appears in the body text (e.g. "Click me")
> Example: `<a href="https://zap-hosting.com/diesisteinaffiliatelink">click me</a>`

``Target``

> You can choose the page your affiliate link redirects to yourself. For example, if you run a Minecraft video channel, you can set the link to redirect to our "[Rent a Minecraft Server](https://zap-hosting.com/de/minecraft-server-mieten/)" page.
> In general, we recommend that you use our [Home](https://zap-hosting.com/de/) as your destination


When you have filled out everything, click on "Create" to create the link.


## Create affiliate banner

To create an affiliate banner, go to the "[Refer a Friend](https://zap-hosting.com/de/customer/affiliate/)" page, click on "Create a new ad" and select the "Banner" button. Then you can create the banner by filling out the following fields and clicking "Create":

'Alias'.

> Next to the banner, a link is created to which the banner refers. You can customize your banner link any way you want so that the link is readable and easy to remember. The alias is attached to "https://zap-hosting.com/". The link will look like this: 
> "https://zap-hosting.com/alias". 
> If you don't create an alias, a random alias will be created.


`Template`

> Here you select the template from a number of different banners. These are stored with us and the HTML code is generated in such a way that the banner is loaded via our site if you install the code correctly.
> You can also upload the banner yourself to your channel or website and link it to your affiliate link. To do this, simply save the desired banner in the preview by right-clicking on it.

`Target`

> You can choose the page your banner link redirects to yourself. For example, if you run a Minecraft video channel, you can set the link to redirect to our "[Rent a Minecraft Server](https://zap-hosting.com/de/minecraft-server-mieten/)" page.
> In general, we recommend that you use our [Home](https://zap-hosting.com/de/) as your destination

When you have filled out everything, click on "Create" to create the banner.
