After this has been set up, you can now connect and open the server folder:

> Make sure that you do not specify more cars than slots on your server, otherwise the server will not start

## Set Cars

In the middle you can see cars which can be placed on the grid, here we can choose cars in the colors which should be in the grid:

Here we now select a free folder where the config data will be stored.

Now the AC Server Manager can be closed, we now open the folder into which the Configs were exported.
