ğŸ“” Preparations

To find the coordinates we need a Coords script like this one:
[CoordsScript](https://github.com/qalle-fivem/qalle_coords)
Install this like this: [Anleitung](fivem_installresources.md)
Did we install this script. Then press ingame */coords*
This will give us the coordinates.

ğŸ“‘ Edit Config

Once we have our coordinates we go to the Config TAB

Here we press **CTRL + F** and search for **ambulance**
We will then open this file.
Here we scroll down until we find **Config_RespawnPoint**.

We will now edit these and replace the coordinates.
After that we just click on Save and that's it.

> After a server restart, the changes will take effect.
