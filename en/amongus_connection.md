If you are finished with the settings you can click on "confirm".
You are now connected to your server!

In the lobby you can now set whether it should be a public or a private server.
To change this you can click on the "Private" or "Public" icon:

If the server is set to "Public" other players can connect to the server in the same way.
These players do not have to click on "Create Game" in the main menu of the game but on "Find Game".
Here it is important that the chat is set to "others" and that the filters match the settings of the server exactly.
Otherwise the server will not be displayed.

If it is a "Private" server you have to click on "Enter Code" in the main menu.
Here you enter the code that the creator of the server can see in the lobby.
