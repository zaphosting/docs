## Order a domain

You can order your domain at ZAP here: [configure domain and order](https://zap-hosting.com/de/shop/product/domain/)

In the field **mydomain.com** you can now search for your domain name and check if it is available or maybe already taken. Domains are always paid one year in advance and must be cancelled or renewed accordingly.

In order to rent a domain, all fields such as first name, surname and address must be filled out truthfully, since there must always be a unique domain holder. Otherwise it is possible that the domain cannot be provided.

>  Since the DSGVO came into force, the domain holder's data has no longer been accessible to everyone. Only the registrar and authorities can access this data if necessary.

## After deployment

### After your domain has been provisioned you will find it on the start page in your interface.
