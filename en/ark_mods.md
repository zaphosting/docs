## Install Mods

The installation of mods for ARK servers is possible by using the Steam Workshop. The mod community in ARK is one of the most active ones in the survival genre. More than 6000 mods can be downloaded via the Steam Workshop. The number of available mods increases daily. Below is an explanation of how you can add those mods to your server.

## Search mods

First of all you have to find out which mods you would like to install on your server. For this we open the Steam Workshop for the ARK game. The workshop can be found here:

https://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/workshop/



Be aware that not all listed items are server mods. Therefore you should make sure that you only add server mods to your server. 



## Add Mods

If you have chosen a mod, then you have to copy the ID of the workshop item of this mod and then add it to the interface. Depending on whether you are browsing the Steam Workshop by using your browser or Steam Client you can copy the ID as shown below:

- **Steam Client**

  Right click on the Steam Workshop page of the mod and click on Copy page url. Copy the ID of the mod from the URL.

- **Browser**

  You will find a combination of numbers after **.../?id=** in the URL bar. Copy it.

This one must then be added to the interface under Steam Workshop. If you want to use more than one mod, then you have to separate them with a comma:

After a restart of the game server, the mods are automatically downloaded and installed correctly.
