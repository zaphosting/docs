## Dashboard

In the dashboard of txAdmin we can see how many players are on the server, and how performant the server is running, here we can also start or stop the server, show announcements on the server, or kick all players:

Below we have options to send a DM to the player, ingame this will be displayed in the chat.

Warnings are displayed as full screen notification in FiveM:

Here we can also specify what functions the account should have available, for example, if it should be only an account for moderating the server, we can enable only the players options, and leave everything else disabled.

Now we get a temporary password, this must be specified when this user logs in, then you can change the password in txAdmin directly:

Done! Now the new user was created, in the future this can be changed or deleted here again.

## txAdmin Log

In the txAdmin log we can see what has been done in the txAdmin interface lately, so we can check for example what created users are doing in the interface:

If you want to add your own startup parameters, this can also be done here, this is useful for forcing certain builds, or running multiple cfg files.

Onesync can also be enabled or disabled here.

If you restart txAdmin often, you can set here if txAdmin should automatically restart the FiveM server, this is enabled by default.

The "Quiet" option determines whether messages in the FiveM console are displayed in the live console of the server, this option is best left disabled.


### Restarter

In Restarter we can set scheduled restarts for the server, here we can insert specific times:

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/HW6bJay6EpxD6X4/preview)

Also we can set here how often a warning should come in the chat, in the "Restart Warnings" parameter these periods are specified as minutes.


### Player Manager

The Player Manager has some features to moderate the server, among others we can activate the ban feature and the whitelist:

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/bbcHQf59w879H9m/preview)

If whitelisting is enabled, we can also specify here what message should come on connect if a player is not yet whitelisted.

The option "Wipe Pending Whitelist On txAdmin Start" determines whether the whitelisting requests that are created when connecting should be deleted when txAdmin restarts, if the whitelisting requests are processed over several days, it is best to disable this option.


### Discord

In the last menu of the settings we can set a Discord Bot, which posts information about txAdmin in a channel, for this the Discord Bot token and the channel ID, in which this information should be posted, must be entered.
