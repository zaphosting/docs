## What is GOTV?


GOTV offers the possibility to broadcast games live with a little delay. This means that outsiders who are not involved in the game can also follow what is happening on the server. This technology is also used in the well-known counter-strike tournaments so that the spectators can watch the spectacle. Furthermore, the transmissions can also be saved automatically, so that you can watch them again afterwards.

## How to use GOTV?

If the function is activated on the server, access is possible via the IP address and the GOTV port assigned to it on the server. To connect, you need the console in the game. There you can then connect with the following command:

```
connect SERVERIP:27020
```


Manual and automatic recorded demos are stored in the main directory (gxxxxx / csgo / csgo /) of the CS: GO server. These can be downloaded via the FTP access provided. If you do not yet know how to access via FTP, you will find instructions on how to do this: https://docs.zap-hosting.com/docs/en/gameserver_ftpaccess/

With the demo playback from the game, the downloaded demo can be selected via **Load** and started via the **Play** button.



## Installation of GOTV Master Server

To activate the GOTV master server, missing commands have to be added in **server.cfg**. These are the following commands:

```
tv_enable 1
tv_delay 90
tv_advertise_watchable 1
```



The above commands are mandatory so that the GOTV master server is activated and accessible. However, there are other commands for advanced configuration below:
