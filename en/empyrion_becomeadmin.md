## üóùÔ∏è locate Steam64ID

Firstly, you would need to locate your Steam64ID.
You can use the following tool: [SteamID Lookup](https://steamid.io/lookup).
The ID will later be entered in the configuration file.

Here you can find an example of how you can get your steamid by inputting your profile link there:
