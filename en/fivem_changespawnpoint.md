## üìî Map out

First of all we have to find out which map is running on our FiveM server.
For this we proceed as follows:
**1** Go to your server's dashboard

## üìë Coordinate resource

Now we need a script that can show us the coordinates.
Like for example : https://github.com/qalle-fivem/qalle_coords
We will now install this.
You can find out how to do this here: https://docs.zap-hosting.com/docs/de/fivem_installresources/

## üîß Open map

Now we open our map which we have found out earlier.
The default maps are located in `server-data/resources/[gamemodes]/[maps]`
We do this e.g. via Filezilla

There we open the Map.lua

Now we get a file with many coordinate entries

From this we now delete **all** entries except two

## üìñ Get coordinates

Now it is time to join our server
Once we have done this we open the coordinates by typing */coords*
Now we have the coordinates.
Now we look for a suitable place and then replace the coordinates

Once this is done we upload the file again.

## üïπ Install Framework
Now, if not already done, we still need a framework on the server.
We can do this under the **Resources** tab
In this case **ESX** is now installed.

**Alternatively, vRP can also be installed**

Now new players spawn at the specified position

## üåè Troubleshooting
If you are not spawning at the position you want, please follow these steps:

Check if you used the right map, often the wrong map is used
Processes really only the map that is used no other, otherwise errors may occur
Empty the cache of your server and restart the server

If you follow these steps it should work
