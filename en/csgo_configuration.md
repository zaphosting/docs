## Server configuration

Counter-Strike servers can be configured widely. Basic settings can be configured via the **Server.cfg** Config and via the settings page in the web interface. The advanced configuration is carried out via the gamemode config files such as gamemode_competitive.cfg, gamemode_custom.cfg, gamemode_casual.cfg, gamemode_cooperative.cfg, gamemode_demolition.cfg, etc.

Under the settings you can choose the gamemode you want to use. The commands of this Config are then accordingly loaded. These can be managed either in the game server administration or manually via FTP under **gXXXXXX/csgo/csgo/cfg/**. 





### General configuration via the interface (Settings)

At the settings page you can adjust basic settings for the GSL token, gametype/gamemode, mapgroup, tickrate and more.

**GSL Token**

Gameserver Login Tokens (GSLTs) is a procedure that Steam has implemented as a protective measure. To run gameservers of certain Steam Games (mainly source games) it is necessary to generate a token. More detailed information can be found here:

[Gameserver Login Token](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/docs/en/source_gsltoken/)



**Gametype**

There are different gamemodes. In the following you see a list of all available options:

- Classic Casual
- Classic Competitive
- Arms Race
- Demolition
- Deathmatch
- Wingman



**Mapgroup**

Mapgroups are groups of maps which normally correspond to a certain category. By default there are the **mg_active, mg_armsrace, mg_demolition, mg_allclassic** groups. Optionally you can create your own. This has to be added to the **Gamemodes_server.txt**. The structure of such a mapgroup is easy to build and looks like this:

```
{	 	 	 	 
 	"mg_meine_mapgroup"	 	 	 
 	{	 	 	 
 	 	"name"	"mg_meine_mapgroup"	 
 	 	"maps"	 	 
 	 	{	 	 
 	 	 	"de_map1"	""
 	 	 	"de_map2"	""
 	 	 	"de_map3"	""
 	 	 	"de_map4"	""
 	 	}	 	 
 	}	 	 	 
}
```



**Tickrate**

The set tick rate determines the frequency of the server sending the position of one player to the other players. The higher the value, the better the gaming experience. The following values can be set: 33, 64, 100 and 128 (best value). 



**Startmap**

The start map is used to determine which map should be loaded during the startup process. It is important that the name of the map is written completely and correctly. The file extension is not necessary. 



**Pingboost**

Pingboost is a way to change the feel of the game by various methods to achieve the lowest possible ping.



## General configuration (server.cfg)

In the **server.cfg** you can change the settings for server name, rcon password and server password.

**hostname**

The host name defines the name of the server. The name will be displayed in the server list and in scoreboard.



**rcon_password **

The rcon_password is needed to execute server commands in the game or via Rcon tools like HLSW. This can be done with the following commands:

```
rcon_password YourPassword
rcon command // For example: rcon changelevel de_dust2
```



**sv_password**

If you want to use your server privately or if you only want certain people to have access to it, you can set a server password. You will be prompted for the password when you connect to the server.



**sv_cheats**

Certain commands are protected and can therefore only be used if cheats are enabled. The command can be enabled or disabled with the value 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Protected commands include, for example:

- god, sv_infinite_ammo, noclip, r_drawothermodels 2, mat_wireframe 2, enable_skeleton_draw 1, mat_fullbright 3 and a few more.



## Gamemode specific configuration (Competitive, Casual, Custom, ...)

As described at the beginning you can define the gamemode/gametype you want to use in the interface at the settings page. After that you have to adjust your settings and modify the corresponding config file. In the gamemode-configs you can make detailed changes to the gameplay, bot behaviour etc.

## Esport-Ready Configuration (ESL Configs)

If you want to use the server for e-sports purposes, it is worth to upload the configs provided by ESL. You can download them from the official site of the ESL: [Download](https://play.eslgaming.com/download/26251762/)

Configs have to be uploaded to the **cfg** directory and can be executed in the game with the following commands:

```
rcon_password YourPassword // Login via rcon to execute rcon commands
rcon exec esl5on5
```

After that, all ESL command values will be loaded and the game can start!
