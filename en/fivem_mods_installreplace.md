## Connect with FTP
First you should connect to your server via FTP, you can use our [FTP-Tutorial](gameserver_ftpaccess.md).

## Preperation

Now create a folder for your mods in the "resources" folder.

> You can name the folder anything as long as it does not contain any special characters. In our example it is "assets".

Now create a __resource.lua file in your freshly created "assets" folder

The following text is now entered in this file:

```
resource_manifest_version '77731fab-63ca-442c-a67b-abc70f28dfa5'
```

Then the __resource.lua can be saved and closed, we no longer need it.

In your assets folder you now create a "stream" folder.

## Upload Mods

Now open this stream folder, here you can now upload all ytd and yft files by drag & drop:

After all the mods have been uploaded, all you have to do is enter your resource in the server.cfg, you will find this in the "server-data" folder of your FiveM server.

You can open this with any text editor, under the "start" entries you can now enter your resource as follows:

Finished! After a server restart, the Carmod should now be found on the server!
