## ðŸ–¥ No internet, what now?

As a rule, the server is "started" when it has no active internet connection as shown below:

But if he is online and still has no internet, you can check this via the serial console:

## ðŸ–¥ How do I re-establish the connection?

First of all, we connect to the server via the serial console as shown below and log into it.

Then, we proceed to open the adapter settings. For this, we do a left click on the internet connection as shown here:

Then, we would click on **change adapter options** as shown here:

Now, we will open the **properties** of the adapter via **right clicking** the Ethernet adapter as shown here:

Then, we will **double click** on the **IPv4 connection** as shown here:

Then, we will check whether the **server's** IP address from the control panel is entered there. In the following, you see an example of how it should be with the IP of "45.146.254.252" in order to work properly:

> Make sure that you enter **your** Server IP under "IP Address"

> It is important here that the subnet mask is always a type C network and is therefore always set as "255.255.255.0".

> The default gateway is always the IP itself with the "1" at the end.

> As a DNS server, you usually use the Google DNS as in the screenshot above.

Then, take over the settings and restart the server if necessary.
