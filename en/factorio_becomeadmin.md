Administrator rights allow you to make changes directly in the game on your server without having to change it in the Config. Adding an admin is done via the **server-settings.json** Config, which you can find in the interface under Configs.

At the end of the config file is the important part. The admins are defined there:

```
  "_comment_admins": "List of case insensitive usernames, that will be promoted immediately",
  "admins": []
}
```

The names of the players who shall receive administrator rights have to be specified there. If several admins are added then it could look like this for example:

```
  "_comment_admins": "List of case insensitive usernames, that will be promoted immediately",
  "admins": [
  	"PlayerName1",
  	"PlayerName2",
  	"PlayerName3"
  ]
}
```

The players with the names **PlayerName1, PlayerName2, PlayerName3** have now received the permissions. Admin commands can now be executed in game via the console. In the following you will find an overview of common used commands.
