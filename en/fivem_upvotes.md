## What are FiveM Upvotes?

FiveM Upvotes is a system that pushes your favourite server higher on the server list, the more Upvotes it has, you can also assign these Upvotes to your own server.

## How do I get Upvotes?

FiveM Upvotes can be purchased from [our shop](https://zap-hosting.com/de/shop/product/fivem-upvotes/).

After your number of Upvotes has been set, you must click on the "FiveM username" field and confirm access to your FiveM forum account:
