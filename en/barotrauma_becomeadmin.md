## Become Admin

Administrator rights allows you to make changes directly in the game on your server without having to change it in the Config. Adding an admin is done via the **Clientpermissions.xml** Config, which you can find in the interface under Configs.

A new client entry must be added to the Config to add a new player. The syntax for this looks like this:

```xml
<Client
    name="<player name>"
    steamid="<steamid>"
    permissions="<permission(s)>">
    <command
      name="<commandname>" />
  </Client>
```



The client entry contains the variables **Name, SteamID, Permissions, and Command**. Those must be modified. The name can be set as desired. It only serves as a placeholder for an overview. Afterwards the SteamID64 of your Steam Account must be defined.

You can find it by accessing your Steam profile and then right-clicking anywhere on the profile. There you can copy the Steam URL of the profile.

Afterwards, the URL must be typed in one of the following websites:

- https://steamrep.com/
- https://steamidfinder.com/
- https://steamid.io/

This will provide you the general account information as well as the Steam ID. In this case the **Steam ID 64** is necessary.  The Steam ID must then be added to the client entry under **SteamID**. The result of this looks like this: 

```xml
<Client
    name="Name"
    steamid="123456789"
    permissions="<permission(s)>">
    <command
      name="<commandname>" />
  </Client>
```



By now you are already admin, but no specific rights have been added to your account yet. You can add them by adding the permissions and commands that can be used. This can be done for example like this:

```xml
...
    permissions="<permission(s)>"> ---> permissions="ServerLog, ConsoleCommands">
...
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ClientPermissions> 
<Client
    name="Name"
    steamid="123456789"
    permissions="ServerLog, ConsoleCommands">
    <command
      name="heal" />
    <command
      name="spawn" />
  </Client>
</ClientPermissions>
```



In this example the admin has been given access to the server logs, console, heal and spawn command. In the following you will find an overview of the permissions you can set.
