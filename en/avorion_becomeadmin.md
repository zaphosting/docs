Once there, you will find a field called **Admin SteamIDs**. There you have to enter your SteamID64. You can find your SteamID64 by first calling up your Steam profile and then right-clicking anywhere there. Then click on **Copy Steam URL**.

Afterwards open one of the following pages and paste the URL of your profile there: 

- https://steamrep.com/
- https://steamidfinder.com/
- https://steamid.io/

This will provide you with general information as well as the Steam ID of your account. In this case we only need the SteamID64. SteamID64 has to be filled into the field accordingly. This should look like this:
