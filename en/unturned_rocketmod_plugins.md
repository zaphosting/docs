## Install plugins on an Unturned Rocket Mod Server

### Step 1️⃣
First, a connection to the server via [FTP](gameserver_ftpaccess.md) must be established.

As soon as the FTP connection is established, the "Plugins" directory must be opened. 
This should be found under 
```
/unturned-rocket/Servers/ZAP001/Rocket/Plugins. 
```
It should also be empty by default:

### Step 2️⃣

Now a plugin can be uploaded. 
Plugins for the Rocketmod can be found for example on Github: https://github.com/RocketModPlugins
After the desired plugin has been downloaded, it must be unpacked. 
Depending on the operating system it can be unpacked directly, but some may require additional programs like 7Zip to unpack the archive.

Under Windows, for example, it is sufficient to open the ZIP archive with a double click and then drag and drop the contents onto the desktop.

Once this is done, it can be uploaded, also via "drag and drop":
