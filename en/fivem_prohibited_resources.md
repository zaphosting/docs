## What does "Resource contains prohibited logic" mean?

FiveM has recently started blocking malicious resources that contain code to infect your Server and other resources on it, that means that those resources try to "spread" their code to other resources, in order to allow Hackers and Cheaters Access to your Scripts and Database.


You can generally compare these resources to viruses.


## What can i do against this?

First of all we highly recommend removing resources that show the message.

then make sure that you only download resources from respectable sources, like the [FiveM Forums](https://forum.cfx.re/), and not from Third Party Websites. Buying Resources is also against the FiveM Terms of Service, and can cause your server to get blacklisted.


## What exact resources are banned?

Sadly there is no official list of Resources that can cause this message, generally it is recommended to avoid resources that have script files made out of random letters/characters in it.

Also, avoid resources where the code is obfuscated or hidden, as that can also be malicious in nature.
