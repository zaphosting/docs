## The gameserver cloud

ZAP-Hosting's game server allows you to change the game that is installed on your game server at any time. To do so, you install a new game via the web interface and activate it on your server. Inactive games will remain and will not be deleted! The following aspects must be considered when changing games:

* In case the host system needs to be changed, existing games on the server will be deleted. This is the case if you want to install a game server for another operating system, for example if you want to switch from ARK (Windows) to Minecraft (Linux).

> You will receive a warning message when changing the host system. Therefore you should make a backup before switching the game!

* You can switch to games with the same or a lower slot price at any time. However, if you want to switch to a game with a higher slot price then there is a surcharge.

> Tip: You can upgrade / downgrade your game server to a lower number of slots and then use the ZAP-Coins to unlock a higher slot price and switch to games with higher slot prices.

* By using our gameserver cloud, you can install and switch between Minecraft modpacks for free.

> Minecraft modpacks have the same slot price. Since no host system change is necessary, no data is deleted when changing games. You can test a new modpack and reactivate your previous server as you need it.

## Change the game

You can add and activate more games in the web interface of your game server under Settings - Games:

You will then be shown a list with the games already installed:

Under "Available games" you can find all games that you can install on your server without additional costs. To install another game, select the game you want to install. For installation press the green button:

After installation, the new game will be displayed in the list of installed games. To change the game, the new game must still be activated:

Once activated, you can play your new game on your server. In the overview you can still activate your old game at any time:

Via the game server cloud, you can reinstall your game servers with one click (Attention: All data of the game will be deleted during reinstallation):

## Change slot prices

If you want to switch to a game that has a higher slot price or you don't need additional slots for a game with a lower slot price, then you can change the slot price of your game server. Games with a higher slot price are listed under "More games". To change the slot price, click on "Change slot price":

You can select your new slot price in the edit box. The additional amount that has to be paid (slot price increase) or the credit will be displayed. The games available at the new slot price are also displayed:

If the slot price changes, your booked slots will automatically be adjusted. Attention: If the slot price is reduced below the slot price for the installed games, then those games will be deleted!
