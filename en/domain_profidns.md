## ❓ What is ProfiDNS anyway?

With the **ProfiDNS function** you can create additional entries (records) for your domain, which you cannot do with the EasyDNS option or if you want to create the desired entries for your domain yourself.

## ✅ Where do I find the ProfiDNS Option and how do I use it?

The option will be displayed, as long as you click on the desired domain in the interface.
If you then scroll down a little, the 3 available options are displayed.
The check mark at ProfiDNS must be clicked + saved so that you can make the entries in the DNS administration afterwards.

On the left hand side you will find the tab "DNS administration" where you can create new entries:

New entries can then be created or existing entries can be edited / deleted here.
