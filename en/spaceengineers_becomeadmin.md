## Become Admin

To be able to manage your own game server well ingame it is important to have the Admin rank.

### SteamID64 over Website

First of all, the profile must be called up in Steam and then right-click anywhere in it.
There you can then copy the Steam URL of the profile.

Once this is done, you can enter the URL on the following websites:

- https://steamidfinder.com/
- https://steamid.io/
- https://steamrep.com/

Next you call your interface and the server. 
There you go to the tab **Configs**

Then you open the **SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg**

Now you write this:
```
<Administrators>
<unsignedLong>STEAM64ID</unsignedLong>
</Administrators>

The whole thing should look like this afterwards:
