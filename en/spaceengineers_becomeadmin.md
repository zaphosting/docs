## üîê Become Admin

To be able to manage your own game server well ingame it is important to have the Admin rank.

### üî¢ SteamID64 over Website

First of all, the profile must be called up in Steam and then right-click anywhere in it.
There you can then copy the Steam URL of the profile.

Once this is done, you can enter the URL on the following websites:
