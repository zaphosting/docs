## ❓ What is ExpertDNS anyway?

With the **ExpertDNS function** you can set which name servers should be used for the domain.

## ✅ Where do I find the ExpertDNS option and how do I use it?

The option is displayed in the domain administration page. **EasyDNS** would be selected by default in there, so you must first check "**expertDNS Activate**"

As soon as activated, further name servers can now be entered there. 
The changes are confirmed with "**Save**".

> You can only use name servers in which the domain was already configured

If the zap-hosting.com name servers are no longer desired, other external name servers can be entered instead.
Confirm the changes with "**Save**".
