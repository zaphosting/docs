## Locked game server ðŸ”’

If your game server has been locked, then the whole thing looks like this:

This is then because you have exceeded your resource limit. We sometimes provide more power for a short time, so that the server is not directly locked as soon as it needs more power for a moment. However, if this is exceeded over a longer period of time, the server will be automatically blocked. By clicking on the red question mark you can see the reason.

There you will also see the upgrades **recommended by us** to solve the problem permanently. Usually this extreme workload is due to mods or scripts that require extreme performance. 

## Unlocking your GameserversðŸ”“

### Option 1 Console
These mods or scripts, can be partially viewed or determined via the console. To do this, you can click on the console to view the latest logs/console lines:

Afterwards the server is **temporarily** activated again. If the server is overloaded again, it is immediately locked again.

### Option 2 Upgrade
For example, if it was triggered due to big things on the server ("farms" "buildings" etc.) and you want to keep them, we offer the recommended upgrade as **option 2**.
