## ‚ùì What is VNC (Serial console)?

VNC or Serial console is a way to connect to your v/RootServer if it has no active internet connection. So if you ever got your ip settings messed up, this is the best solution to fix it.


## üíª How do i use VNC?
The VNC console can be accessed via the menu on the left side.

Then the web client of the VNC console opens. Here you can now log in even if the server has no active internet connection. Just press the "Send CtrlAltDel" button and login with your username and password.

Now you can use and manage your server as usual.

**If it doesn't work with the password, you can use the on-screen keyboard to make sure that the correct keyboard is set.**
