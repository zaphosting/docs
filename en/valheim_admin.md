## 🔑 Adding yourself as Admin

### Getting your Steam ID
To Add yourself as Admin, you first need to get your SteamID64, you can use a tool like the [Steam ID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/)

Here you enter your Steam URL:

Then press `Find Steam ID`

Now we should be able to see our Steam Profile, here we copy our "Steam64ID (Dec)".

Now we open our Servers Webinterface and open the Settings Page, here we will see an "Admins" Option where we can add our Steam ID:
