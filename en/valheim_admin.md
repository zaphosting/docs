## Install the Correct Game

First of all we have to make sure that the game is on our server `Valheim`, unfortunately `Valheim (old)` does not work.

To change the game we first open the games tab on our server:

Here we search for Valheim under "Available games" and click on the download button:

Now we get a warning, this we simply confirm:

After that the server will be reinstalled, after the reinstallation the admin rights can be managed.

Then press `Submit`

Now we should be able to see our Steam Profile, here we copy our "Steam64ID (Dec)".
