# Adding yourself as Admin

## Install the Correct Game

First of all we have to make sure that the game is on our server `Valheim`, unfortunately `Valheim (old)` does not work.

To change the game we first open the games tab on our server:

Here we search for Valheim under "Available games" and click on the download button:

Now we get a warning, this we simply confirm:

After that the server will be reinstalled, after the reinstallation the admin rights can be managed.

## Getting your Steam ID
To Add yourself as Admin, you first need to get your SteamID64, you can use a tool like the [Steam ID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/)

Here you enter your Steam URL:

Then press `Submit`

Now we should be able to see our Steam Profile, here we copy our "Steam64ID (Dec)".


## Adding yourself as Admin

Now we open our Servers Webinterface and open the Settings Page, here we will see an "Admins" Option where we can add our Steam ID:

After we have added our Steam ID, we save the Settings and then Restart the Server.
