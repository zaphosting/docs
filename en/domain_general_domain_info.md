## What is actually a domain? 

A domain can represent your name or project on the Internet and make it accessible worldwide.
You can use a domain to make a website accessible online, for example, 
you can also redirect a domain to a Game or TeamSpeak 3 server and have it 
then also reach online with an easy to remember name.


### Subdomains

A **subdomain** is a subdomain which you can create for your existing domain at any time free of charge.
This is done via the DNS settings, a subdomain can look like this for example: **server.fivem-server.com**
Here **server** is your subdomain and **fivem-server.de** is the name of the actual domain.
A subdomain usually redirects to a different address than the actual domain,
for example, you can make your website reachable with **fivem-server.de** while you can make your website reachable with **server.fivem-server.de**
to your FiveM or another game server.
You will find the DNS settings in the menu on the left.


### Domain's and IP addresses

In contrast to an IP address you have to rent a domain individually, this is **NOT** automatically included with a game server, root server, vServer or voice server.
A domain is already different in appearance from an IP address. While an IP address consists of numbers, for example **140.82.118.3**, a domain has a 
correct name and a corresponding domain ending, for example fivem.net. Here **fivem** would be the name of the domain and **.net** the domain ending.
Besides **.net** there are of course many other domain extensions like **.com** or **.de**.
