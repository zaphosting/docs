## Introduction

Are you unsure about what you need to connect to your server in general or how to do it exactly? Don't worry! We will explain you in the following step by step what you will need to connect to your server, how to connect to it afterwards and what to consider in general. This should allow you to successfully connect to your server without any problems! :)

## Requirements

First of all, it is necessary to clarify which requirements have to be met so that a connection to the server is possible. This includes, for example, the game, additional content (extensions) such as mods/plugins and the general server information such as IP address, port and server name.



### Game / Contents

For the connection to your game server, it is mandatory that you already own the game. This is not provided by us when renting a server. It is also relevant whether you are using the vanilla or a custom version of Minecraft. When using a mod pack, it is important that you install the mod pack with the same version on your computer so that a connection can be established. The necessary mod pack launcher can be identified by the game name. For example, most mod packs run through the [Curse/Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/) and [Technique Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/).



### Server information

Provided that all requirements of **Game / Content** are met, you will need the information of your server. Click on your game server service in your dashboard. The overview will now show you all general information about your server.

The relevant information includes the **IP address,** **Port** and **Password**. You should remember these, because you will need them for your first connection to your server.



## Connect to the server

Once all the requirements have been met, you can begin to connect to the server. To do this, start your game via the Minecraft or Mod pack launcher and navigate to the Multiplayer menu option. Then click on Add Server. There you can enter a name as a placeholder and the IP address/port.

## Potential problems and **solutions**

The establishment of the connection does not work as expected? This may happen in certain situations, when the connection fails due to a technical problem. We have listed the most common problems and their solutions below:



### Not visible

A lack of visibility of the server can occur if the initialization was not completed successfully for some reason. This may for example be due to a faulty configuration, faulty mods/plugins or corrupted files. Further information can usually be traced in the server console or log files.



### Connection failed

**Connection failed, Connection timed out.:** This error message means that a connection with the server could not be established within the scheduled time frame. The causes for this can be various. More information can usually be found in the logs or live console.

**Mismatched mod channel list**: This error message occurs when there is a difference in mods between the client and the server. This can for example occur if individual mods are missing or they are installed for a different version. In this case, the mods should preferably be reinstalled and checked on the client and the server.
