> **Important** To manage the server with Content Manager, the full version is required, the lite version can *not* manage servers.


## Preparation

First, we open our Content Manager and click on the sandwich menu at the top right, where we select "Server":

## Set Server Slots

We first need to set how much capacity our server has, in our case our server is only 10 slots, so we select '10' for Capacity:

## Configure FTP Upload

Via the "Advanced" menu we can configure an FTP uploader so that you can upload your server config with one click.

Now enter your FTP data here:

> In the "Folder" you must enter the ID of your game server as you see it in the URL of your game server, for example:
> > https://zap-hosting.com/en/customer/gameserver/show/**300395**/ftpBrowser/

In our case, the whole thing would be:

```
/g300395/assetto-corsa/
```

After that you can click on "Upload Content", the config, track and cars that have been configured will be uploaded automatically, then you only need to start your server!
