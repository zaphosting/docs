We must first make sure that "Force overwrite" is disabled.
Therefore we go to the tab "Resources".

## ðŸ“‘ Find and edit Config

Once we have done this we open the Config page and search for es_extended.
Just press CTRL + F and search for es_extended.
Then you better find it fast.
We'll work on these.

Now let's have a look: Config.EnableHUD.

We then set this to false and save the file.

When you have done that you only have to restart the server and that's it.
