## 🔧 Why do I need a key?

The key is needed so that the servers are verified and can communicate with the online services.

## 📋 Preparation

To create / display the mentioned keys, you have to log in to "https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/" first.
Then click on "Settings":

## 🖥️ Game Key + Host Key

Once here, you can already see your game server key.
You have to enter the key in the interface of the server under the tab "Settings" at "Customer Key":

Below that you can create a provider key by clicking on "Add New Key":

Here you can assign a name and a description to the key, so that you can clearly assign the key.
In our example we enter the following:

> Attention! A provider key can only be used for one server, for each additional server a new provider key must be created and assigned!


## Realm
Now we need to create a realm where the servers can be entered.
To do this, go back to the dashboard on the myrealm.lastoasis.gg page:

Further down the page you can then click on "Create Realm" to create a realm.

This is necessary so that you can connect to your server at all.

You can choose the name freely, in our example we call it "ZAP-Hosting Test Realm".

## Realm overview
Afterwards you will find an overview of the realm you just created where you can change many settings:

To change settings there, you just have to click on the blue "Change" button.

## Create oasis
Now you need to create an oasis, which will reflect your server.
For each server you have to create an oasis.
So if you have 2 game servers, you have to create a separate oasis for each of the two game servers.

To create the oasis, you can click on "Manage" in the realm overview:

Now select a desired place for your "oasis":

Then click on "Add" as far as you have decided for a place:

Here you can give the "Oasis" a name and select the map:

And then click on "Add Oasis" so that it is created.
Now you have to go back to the overview of your realm and can activate the oasis there:

As far as this is done, you can restart your server and then connect to it ingame.
