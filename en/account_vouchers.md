As soon as you are logged in, you will automatically land in your web interface. To use a code now, you should first find out what kind of code you want to redeem. Basically there are two different types of coupon codes:

    1. codes that increase your ZAP credit (**voucher codes**)
    2. codes that reduce the price of an order (**discount codes**)

## Credit codes

Credit codes can be redeemed by simply clicking on ZAP Coins at the top of your web interface.

On the next page you can choose whether you want to deposit money, top up credit automatically or redeem a voucher. So click on ** Redeem voucher**.

A popup will open where you can now insert the code.

If the voucher is entered correctly, is still valid and has not already been used by you, the amount is automatically booked to your ZAP account.

> If a code does not work, it may be that it has already expired, has already been used or that the code is not a credit code.

## Discount codes

Discount codes work similar to credit codes, but are used elsewhere in the web interface. They already reduce the cost of the package you want to book during the ordering process. To redeem these codes, simply do the following:
Find the product you want to order and configure it according to your wishes.

Once everything is configured correctly, you can still use your code in the ordering process. Just click on **redeem voucher** below the order costs.

The costs are automatically reduced as soon as you redeem the voucher. 

> There are two different discount codes:

2. codes that permanently reduce costs during the runtime
