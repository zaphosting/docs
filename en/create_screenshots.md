## Create screenshots

In some cases it is necessary to send screenshots to the support.
For this to be possible, the screenshot(s) must be shared via a link. 
This link can be a link to an own cloud or to a "web uploader", also called web screenshot tools. 

If your own cloud or the web screenshot tool does not offer a function to create a screenshot directly, it can usually be created on the PC with simple tools. 
Under Windows, it is sufficient to use the tool "Snipping Tool". With this tool, a screenshot can be saved locally, this can then be uploaded. 
Under Linux, the usually already installed tool "Screenshots" or other tools such as "FlameShot" can be used to create local screenshots, which can then be uploaded.


Below we will provide a short description of the 2 most popular screenshot tools that are freely available on the market:

> ⚠️ It is not recommended to share private or sensitive data publicly. If data is visible on the screenshot, it should be made unrecognizable or replaced by example data.


### Imgur

Imgur offer an uploader for own files like pictures/videos. 
After the upload is done, a link is created. 
This can then be shared with others. 

Important: Since there is no screenshot function there, the screenshot must be made beforehand so that it can be uploaded afterwards (see above under "Create screenshots").
