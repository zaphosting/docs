## ü§ó More than just "customers" - the ZAP-Hosting.com community
We haven't been talking about "customers" for a long time now - many interact so frequently and intensively with our social-media offerings that we tend to see our customers as a community. In the following, we give a detailed list of all offers that we make available in addition to our products.

## üê¶ Twitter
Under the [Handle @zaphosting](https://twitter.com/zaphosting) we twitter almost daily about our new products, what's happening in the company and the best recipes around pizza. (Yes, also Cat-Content is offered)

## üì∑ Instagram
More picture, but not less content! On [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zaphosting/) we offer insights into our office life and especially our Instagram Stories. Nothing comes much closer to our everyday life!

## üî¥ Twitch
Whoever deals with game servers must of course also test them. Exactly for this reason we fulfilled the wish and established a [own Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/zaphostinglive/)! Here we are regularly live and present among other things our gameservers, test new modpacks, or realize gigantic giveaways!

## üí¨ Discord
Of course we also offer our community a common Discord Server. Here you get the chance to exchange with other gamers, get informed about new updates and chat with our staff. You want to join the server? Then use [this invitation](https://discord.gg/wsNeN2k).

## ‚úâÔ∏è The direct line
Of course, you can also contact us personally via any of the platforms mentioned above. However, we would like to stress that we cannot and will not offer direct support via social media. If you have server-related problems, please *always* contact our live chat or the ticket system directly as described in /firststeps_problem_report. For all other concerns we are always available here.
