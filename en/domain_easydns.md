## ❓ What is EasyDNS anyway?

With the **EasyDNS function** the forwarding of a domain, which was rented with **us**, to another product on the **same** account can be set with one click.

## ✅ Where do I find the EasyDNS option and how do I use it?

The option will be shown, if you click on the desired domain in the interface.

Once here, you can then select an existing service from a list.
As shown in the example above.
Select the desired service and confirm it by clicking the "Save" button.
There is also the option to forward your domain to a Minecraft server with a subdomain.

Here you can enter the name of the **desired subdomain** in the first field.
On the right side you choose the desired **Minecraft Server**, which you want to link to the subdomain.

> Please note that it can take up to 24 hours until changes to the domains have been adopted globally!
