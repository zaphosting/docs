## Connect to FTP

Before mods can be installed, the [FTP access](gameserver_ftpaccess.md) must be set up:

After this has been set up, you can now connect and open the server folder:

## Preparation

First we open the Assetto Corsa folder, we can open it by opening Steam and right-clicking "Assetto Corsa" in the Games List, then we select "Properties"

## Upload Config

Now we can save the Config with the "Save" button and export it with the "Export" button:

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/ixFdiQHfA9q6ca4/preview)

Here we now select a free folder where the config data will be stored.

Now the AC Server Manager can be closed, we now open the folder into which the Configs were exported.

These Configs can now be copied via Drag&Drop into the "cfg" folder of your gameserver.

The server can now be started with the new Config.


## Upload Server Content

Now we have to generate the content for the server, so that Car&Map Mods are loaded on the server. To do this we first click on "Update Server Content" below

![](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/BJj6fGbfiitYPMM/preview)

This process can take a few minutes, all Maps & Cars are now converted to server files.

> After this process is finished, a "Could not update" message may appear, this is not a problem.

Now we open the "Server" folder, where the AcServerManager is located, there is a "Content" folder, which we now upload to our Assetto Corsa Server via Drag&Drop, and overwrite our old "Content" folder:

After the content is uploaded, the carmods are installed and active after a server restart.
