## 💸 Payment process
The payment process is simple: the server configuration is put together on the configuration page, at the bottom of the page the desired payment option is selected. After a click on "Buy now", a redirection to the selected payment service provider will take place if necessary, via which the payment can be made. After receiving the payment, the server is set up within a few seconds.

## 🏦 ZAP-Credits: Deposit
ZAP-Credits can be deposited via all other payment options offered by us and also contract servers can be paid via ZAP-Coins. In the web interface you can deposit ZAP-Credits under the point **Cash in** in your Cashbox.
> A proportionate financing via credit is not possible. If you already have credit, for example because you have a credit code, you can add credit as you like. Tip: If you pay with ZAP-Credits, pay attention to our Cash In Deals: If the Cash In Deal is activated, you will receive additional credit if you increase your deposit.
Transfers can be used to deposit ZAP credits. As soon as we have received the transfer, the credit will be activated and can be used.
