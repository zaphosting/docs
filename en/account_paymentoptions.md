Tip: If you pay with ZAP-Credits, pay attention to our Cash In Deals: If the Cash In Deal is activated, you will receive additional credit if you increase your deposit.
Transfers can be used to deposit ZAP credits. As soon as we have received the transfer, the credit will be activated and can be used.
