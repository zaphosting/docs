After a click on "Buy now", a redirection to the selected payment service provider will take place if necessary, via which the payment can be made. After receiving the payment, the server is set up within a few seconds.

## 🏦 ZAP Coins: Deposit
ZAP Coins can be deposited via all other payment options offered by us and also contract servers can be paid via ZAP Coins. In the web interface you can deposit ZAP Coins under the point **Cash in** in your Cashbox.
> A proportionate financing via ZAP Coins is not possible. If you already have ZAP Coins, for example because you have a ZAP Coins code, you can add credit as you like. Tip: If you pay with ZAP Coins, pay attention to our Cash In Deals: If the Cash In Deal is activated, you will receive additional credit if you increase your deposit.
Transfers can be used to deposit ZAP Coins. As soon as we have received the transfer, the credit will be activated and can be used.
