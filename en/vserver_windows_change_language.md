ZAP hosting offers the Windows Server products in German and English as default options. During the order process and in the server settings you can choose between these languages. You prefer to use a different language? Then you are in the right place!

In the following, we explain how you can set up/install another language. To do this you have to connect to your server via remote desktop connection.

Once the connection has been established, you have to navigate to the Windows settings. You can find and access the settings via the Windows start menu. Once there we go to the options of **time and language**.

Once the language has been added, it must be selected and the options called up. The language packs of the added language can be downloaded there.![img](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/RHkmkDoWiF7Ko3W/preview)

At the end the language must be set as default. Select country/region and click on **As default** for the language.![img](https://screensaver01.zap-hosting.com/index.php/s/YFZHFy88bqbxcdq/preview)
