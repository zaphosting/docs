## ❓ What is RCON?

Rcon is a protocol for executing commands on the server without having direct access to the console.

### Enable WebRCON

Firstly before you can connect, you must make sure Web RCON is enabled.
To enable it, visit the **Settings** tab.

And then enable it directly on this page.

> A server restart would be required for it to take affect. 

### Install RCON Program

You will be required to connect to it from an RCON Program. There are several different ones available you could use.
For this example, and as a reccomendation, you can download [RustAdmin](https://www.rustadmin.com/).

You can install it with the button directly on their website.

## 🖥️ Connect via RCON 

Once you have opened WebAdmin, press the **Server** at the top. And then press **Connect**.

> Your server must be fully ONLINE to be reachable from RCON.

Then you are redirected to a Configuration page.
Here you would enter your respective server information.
