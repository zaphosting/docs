## Cloud Gameserver
A cloud game server has the advantage that it supports a wide range of games. This supports any games that we have in our range and is therefore recommended for all customers who like to play many different games online. However, in contrast to the Lifetime game servers, this product has a [product runtime](https://docs.zap-hosting.com/docs/en/firststeps_rent_contractorprepaid).

## Lifetime Gameserver
The lifetime game server has the advantage that it has no runtime and therefore runs for a lifetime. This **only supports Minecraft products** and is therefore currently not recommended for customers who want to run another game on their server.
