## ♻️ Changing your FiveM Version
Thanks to our gamecloud, you can easily switch between all fivem versions for free.

> ⚠️ The change between the linux based Games (txAdmin, ESX Roleplay, FiveM Linux) to Windows, will erase all data

You should always have a backup of your data, you can easily create one in your "Backup"-tab in the interface.

## 🔧 The change in detail
To change the game (the version) of your FiveM-Server, you need to open "Games" in our interface.

Choose the version of your like and press the green button to start the installation. There will be a popup which requires a confirmation to start the process.

> ⚠️ A change between Linux and Windows, changes the ip address of your server, if you haven't booked your own

> ⚠️ If you switch between ESX RP, Linux or txAdmin you need to enable the version after the installation with the blue button in Games
