> In this example, the installation of FreeBSD 13.0 is performed

## ðŸ“‹ Preparations
In your ZAP interface, select the desired ISO of FreeBSD and let the server boot with the ISO until it is in the setup process.

> Navigation in the setup process is done with TAB, Space and Enter.
> TAB = switch between items, Space = highlight, Enter = confirm

***

## âŒš The setup
When the ISO is successfully loaded, the server is in the setup process.

More informations about RAIDs are explained in our special guide.

You can proceed with `Enter` if there are no changes

The setup is now done, choose "Exit" and confirm by pressing `Enter`

> Remove the ISO-File in your iLO and choose "Reboot"

### ðŸ’» Network

To enable the network device, please login to your system using the password

Open loader.conf with a editor of your decision, as example `ee /boot/loader.conf` and add the following line:

```if_oce_load="YES"```

You can leave the editor by pressing `CTRL+C` and writing exit, after that please reboot your dedicated server

***

After the reboot, we need to modify the rc.conf as example by `ee /etc/rc.conf`, add the following lines:

```
ifconfig_oce0="inet YourIP netmask 255.255.255.0"
defaultrouter="YourGateway"
```
YourIP is the IP address of your dedicated server, this is showed in your ZAP interface.
At "defaultrouter" its required to fillin the default gateway, this is always your server ip with a .1 in the end, as example:

Server IP: 123.123.123.123

Subnetmask: 255.255.255.0

Gateway: 123.123.123.1

This should in example look like:

Leave the editor by pressing `CTRL+C`and writing "exit" after that execute the command `/etc/netstart` once

> Your server should have an active internet connection now
