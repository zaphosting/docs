## 🤔 Is something going wrong?

Your server won't start? Or are there problems that you can't solve on your own? No problem! We are here for you. However, we recommend the following procedure in order to enable a quick and uncomplicated use of your products.


Whether only your server is affected, a whole cluster or even the whole data center, you can easily find out in our [Fault Reports](https://zap-hosting.com/de/interruption/) where we provide exact information about current malfunctions and failures. If one of your products is acutely affected, we will inform you about a malfunction via a symbol next to your product.


If you have not found any information at either of the two contact points that would indicate a malfunction, you can contact our specialists in the [Live Chat](https://zap-hosting.com/de/) around the clock.

> Our Live Chat is available for you around the clock. However, it is possible that there may be a waiting period. The length of this time depends on the current rush and is clearly displayed for you at the top of the chat window.


## 😅 A ticket saves time!

If live chat is not an option for you and you still want to report your problem to our support team? Then simply create a [Ticket](https://zap-hosting.com/de/customer/support/) in your web interface! Just fill in the form with all the necessary information that is relevant for a solution of your problem. This includes:

* The topic to which your request refers

* The server or subject your request is about

* A detailed description of your problem *(Since when has the problem existed? How often does it happen? What was changed on the server before?)*

## ☹️ No help via social media?

No, because our customer data is sacred to us - just like fast support. That's exactly why we refer customers who ask us for direct advice in Tweets, Facebook PN's or on Instagram **always** to our Live Chat. This is the only way our supporters have direct access to the affected products and can solve any problems.
