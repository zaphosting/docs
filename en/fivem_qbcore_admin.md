## 🛡️ Become an admin

Thanks to our web interface you can quickly and easily become an admin.
Open the settings of your server:

there look for the option "Admins - Steam64 IDs (e.g. for Nucleus, vMenu, EasyAdmin)".

in the next step you have to find out your STEAM64 ID, open one of the following pages:

- https://steamrep.com/
- https://steamidfinder.com/
- https://steamid.io/

in this example we use steamid.io, log in there via STEAM:

now copy your STEAM64 ID and paste it into the admins:

Now scroll to the end of the page and click save.

> ⚡ Restart your server now, then you can open the QBCore admin menu with /admin.
