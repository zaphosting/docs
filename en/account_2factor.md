Here you can download the Authenticator App with your mobile phone: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=de

In the app you can then activate it under **scan barcode**:

Afterwards you have to enter a code when logging in which will be displayed in the app.

## How do I deactivate Two-Factor Authentication?

To **deactivate Two-Factor Authentication** you can go back to the Security tab and select Deactivate:

If you no longer have the app or your mobile phone the second option would be to send an email to **support@zap-hosting.com**. **This email must come from the account email**. Afterwards the support will deactivate it for you.
